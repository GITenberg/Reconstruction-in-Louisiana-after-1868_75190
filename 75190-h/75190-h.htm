<p class="ph3">A Brief Resumé of Reconstruction in
Louisiana before 1869</p>


<p>By January 1, 1869, Louisiana had suffered the throes
of reconstruction for seven weary years, but the
hostile fates had decreed for her more than another
seven before she should be able to wrench herself
free from the grasp of her colored and carpet-bag despots.
The first uncertain attempts at reconstruction were made
at the close of 1862 by Governor Shepley with the consent
of Lincoln. The President’s policy was based upon the
belief that there existed in every Southern State a loyal
element which might be made to prove the germ of a civil
government owning allegiance to Washington. In the
course of that year, as the North gained a foothold, he
had appointed General Shepley military governor, whose
duty it was to resurrect the loyal element among the
people. Thanks to the vigorous grip over New Orleans of
Generals Butler and Banks, a considerable body, stronger
in numbers than social prestige, became firmly wedded
to the Union cause. The old Douglas men sprang into
evidence at Butler’s arrival on the scene; members of the
Irish Unionists came out strongly; while still others were
won by the favors distributed with an eye to political
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>gain. General Shepley ordered an election on December
3 for two Congressmen. The successful candidates
proved to be B. F. Flanders and Michael Hahn, both
of whom were allowed to take their seats in the National
legislature.</p>

<p>There appeared a certain group of men eager to push
on the work of reorganization, either for the plums of
office, or, on the part of the old slave-holders, for the
sake of saving a portion of their slaves, or for the sake
of casting off martial law. This group, the Free State
Party, working through the Union Clubs, urged on in 1863
a registration and convention to frame a new constitution.
But it made such slow progress that Lincoln
developed his famous “Ten Per Cent” plan by his proclamation
of December 8, 1863, which offered pardon and
the restoration of property to all who would take a prescribed
oath; and declared that the President would recognize
as the true government of any of the seceded
States, except Virginia, the organizations set up by loyal
citizens, provided that they constituted one-tenth of the
voting population of 1860.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>General Banks, in accordance with this plan, ordered an
election of State officers for February 22, 1864. Hahn,
the successful administration candidate, was inaugurated
on March 4. About ten days later he was invested
with the “powers exercised before by the military governor.”
It is of importance to note that as early as this
campaign the issue in the radical party was the treatment
of the negroes after emancipation. Delegates to a constitutional
convention were subsequently chosen and
April 6, ninety-four<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the men elected met in New
Orleans, a fair set of men, but already showing a tendency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>toward that extravagance which was later to be such
a blot upon reconstruction. The convention abolished
slavery,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but restricted suffrage to white males, although
it empowered the legislature to confer it on “such persons,
citizens of the United States, as by military service, by
taxation to support the government, or by intellectual fitness
may be deemed entitled thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A constitution
was adopted and submitted to the people, but only 8402
votes were cast in ratification as compared with 11,411<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
in the election of Hahn. The new legislature provided
for met October 3, elected two Senators, and adopted
the Thirteenth Amendment unanimously. Although
this government was duly recognized by the President
and its ratification of the Amendment gladly counted to
help embody it in the organic law, its authority was
restricted to a very narrow limit—that actually within
the Union military lines<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>—and neither branch of Congress
admitted the members chosen by the new government,
while the Presidential vote of 1865 was rejected.</p>

<p>The legislature of 1865, fully representative of the State,
and just as fully Democratic, met in extra session to
elect two new Senators in case the two elected previously
be rejected as not truly representative. With these two
Senators, Henry Clay Warmoth presented himself at
Washington as territorial delegate of the radical Republicans
of the State,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> his expenses defrayed by his negro
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>constituents, who joyfully deposited their half-dollars
with their first ballots to pay the expenses of their impecunious
delegate.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Some thirty or more of the members of the convention
of 1864 were so angered at seeing the offices of the State
passing to the ex-rebels that, with the consent of the
governor and a judge of the Supreme Court, they began
to meet and plan how they could evict them. Before
adjourning, the convention of 1864 had decreed that it
might be reconvoked at the call of the President “for
any cause, or in case the constitution should not be
ratified, for the purpose of taking such measures
as may be necessary for the formation of a civil
government for the State of Louisiana.” This resolution,
however, had not been incorporated in the constitution
and had never been passed upon by the
people.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The opponents of negro suffrage denied the right of
the convention to resume its functions and the controversy
over the matter became very fierce. July 30, 1866,
the delegates who favored reassembling proceeded to do
so, according to call in New Orleans. A street procession
of negroes, on their way to the hall, became involved
in a serious fight with the police and crowds of white
spectators. The number killed and injured amounted
to about two hundred and the fact stood out conspicuously
that of this number only about a dozen were
policemen or their white allies. The North and, more
especially, Congress was forced by this episode, together
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>with the rejection of the Fourteenth Amendment<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the
passage throughout the South of the “Black Codes,”
to the conclusion that the colored people were not safe
in the hands of their former masters.</p>

<p>Hence, the Congressional plan of reconstruction, long
brewing,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was forced on the South in the Acts of March
2, 1867, which reëstablished military rule and provided
an entire new organization of government through a
convention, elected by negro as well as white vote, and
a new constitution, which should be acceptable to Congress<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>;
in the Supplementary Act of March 23 which
placed the initiative in the hands of the military instead
of the State<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; and the additional Act of July 19 which
substituted for the liberal interpretation of the earlier
acts by civil officials the most rigorous possible and
stripped the Executive of the power of determining removals
by explicitly conferring certain powers of appointment
and removal on the general of the army.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Louisiana
and Texas constituted one military department, placed
first under the direction of General Sheridan, and in
August under General Hancock. Under these two commanders
registration was pushed on so as to record as
many blacks and as few whites as possible. In September
a convention of ninety-eight members was elected, consisting
by previous agreement of blacks and whites in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>equal numbers, all but two, Republicans. The body
sat in daily session from November 23 to March 9,
ostensibly to frame the new constitution, but, because
of the lack of a revenue, constituting itself also a legislative
body. The constitution framed by it was the
most severe in its disfranchising clauses of any in the
South.</p>

<p>It was quietly ratified April 16 and 17, 1868, and State
officers chosen. H. C. Warmoth was elected governor
and the mulatto, O. J. Dunn, lieutenant-governor. The
military governor was removed and the governor-elect
placed in power at once although his formal inauguration
did not occur until July 13, 1868. The first legislature
of the new régime, in which a sweeping radical victory
against the unorganized, disheartened conservatives had
seated a strong Republican majority, was in session from
June 29 to October 20. The ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment by this body opened the door of re-admission
to the Union so that by the act of June 25,
1868, Louisiana was once more empowered to send W. P.
Kellogg and J. B. Harris to occupy the seats in the Senate
vacated defiantly seven years before by John Slidell and
J. P. Benjamin. By July 18, five Representatives had
been seated in the House, including the first colored
person to present himself for admission to Congress;
and reconstruction would seem to be a matter of
history.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>But the military was not withdrawn, for Louisiana
and Arkansas were created into the Department of Louisiana
under General Rousseau. Troops were so stationed
at different points throughout these States that they
could be called upon to coöperate with the State authorities
to preserve the peace and to sustain the new
governments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>The Presidential election of the fall of that year once
more centered attention on the State by an undesired and
wholly unexpected victory for Seymour and Blair, and
still more by the disorders and outrages on the negroes.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Congress was not allowed to forget that it had a right to
a directing influence in the matter through committees
of investigation and decisions on disputed elections to
its own body.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1869 carpet-bag government
was in full swing and the picture of the situation in
the State is not a bright one.</p>

<p>The political condition might well have caused an
aristocratic Louisianian to withdraw himself from the
contamination of politics with a shudder of despair: a
carpet-bagger the recipient of the first honor in the gift
of the State, and a negro house-painter of the second.
Warmoth, young, handsome, and magnetic,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> was a native
of Illinois, who had entered the army from Missouri.
He had had trouble with General Grant after the battle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>of Vicksburg; was charged with circulating exaggerated
reports of the Union losses while on parole North, was
dismissed from the service by Grant, but restored to his
command by Lincoln, evidence having shown his dismissal
to be unjust. He retired from the army in 1865, went
to Texas, where he was indicted for embezzlement and
for appropriating government cotton. But when the
case was called, no prosecutor appeared and the prosecution
was abandoned. He returned to Louisiana and before
reconstruction was sent as a delegate to Congress as
narrated above. He was at this time only twenty-six
years old, apparently at the height of his powers, social
and political, for even his foes admitted the dignity
of his appearance and the charm of his manners and
conversation.</p>

<p>The balance of parties in 1868 stood twenty Republicans
to sixteen Democrats in the Senate, fifty-six to forty-five
in the House.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> White members had been almost entirely
supervisors of registration. Warmoth had selected for
this office in the parishes a large number of men left in
New Orleans as flotsam after the war. They had so
impressed the negroes that they were returned to the
legislature or were mysteriously counted in by the returning-board.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Almost one-half of the House were negroes,
while there were at least seven sable-hued Senators.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
The lower State and parish offices were given over largely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>to negroes and scalawags, not always chosen by the
governor with wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The comment of one of the New Orleans papers is
suggestive of the sentiment of the people toward their
legislature. Speaking of the revenue bill of 1869 it said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was the work of the lowest and most corrupt body of
men ever assembled in the South. It was the work of ignorant
negroes<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> coöperating with a gang of white adventurers,
strangers to our interests and our sentiments. It was originated
by carpet-baggers and was carried through by such
arguments as are printed on green-backed paper. It was one
of the long catalogs of schemes of corruption which makes
up the whole history of that iniquitous Radical Conclave.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Or note the <i>Crescent</i>: “The troupe which is now playing
a sixty-day engagement at the corner of Royal and Conti
streets,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which appears daily in the farce of ‘How to be
a Legislature,’ a day or two since introduced among
themselves a bill...”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> And that paper printed later daily
the following unique “ad,” “Go at once to the St. Louis
Rotunda to see the astounding curiosity &amp;.”</p>

<p>No less important to the State than its own political
condition was the attitude of the National government.
The defeat of the Republican party in the South in the
fall election was like a dash of cold water. To an indifference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>or even a desire to be rid of the whole subject of
reconstruction, which had characterized Congress in the
fall of 1868, succeeded a resolute purpose to take advantage
of every opportunity to gain an effective and permanent
control for the Republican party. Even the law
passed during the session of 1868-9, which provided that
equal eligibility to office should inhere in those who had
had their disabilities removed by Congress and had taken
the oath to support the constitution in the act of July
11, 1868, was only a party measure to win more firmly
the scalawags,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> as the list of pardons reveals the fact
that most had become Republicans.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Grant’s attitude
was of importance to a degree that Johnson’s was not,
for he came into office early in 1869, a popular and trusted
executive, who would be free, to a large extent, to direct
the policy of the government in the South. But, unfortunately
for Louisiana, a brother-in-law, J. F. Casey,
was soon put in charge of the port there and so completely
won Grant’s ear that the latter approached Louisiana
problems with a bias. Friction between the State and
National authorities was bound to come, for already at
the opening of 1869 the radicals had lost the respect of the
army, and recrimination was passing back and forth between
the military commander and the executive of the State.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Socially, the problem was largely a race question,
though the bitterness of feeling toward her conquerors
and contempt of carpet-bagger and scalawag enter to
complicate the matter. The intensity of her bitterness
toward the North found expression in such paragraphs
as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The black and bloody chapter of American subjugation
reads so much like the scenes of the Netherlands and the
Palatinate that it cannot claim even the vile merit of distinguished
infamy. Let it be blotted out and closed. Let
the American government publish and execute this amnesty
in good faith. Let them seek new fields of glory and cease
to promote men merely because they have distinguished
themselves by the slaughter of Americans or by laying waste
the regions that Americans have planted.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In moments of calmness appeals to the better sentiment
of the North are heard, coupled with promises that a
spirit of conciliation would be seconded by the masses
of the South, which were prepared to accept all necessary
and reasonable conditions imposed by the result of the
war.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Their particular spleen was vented now vindictively,
now humorously, on the carpet-baggers: “Only call off
the carpet-baggers and you are welcome to substitute an
army of hand-organists in their stead. No sounds can
punish our nerves, our patience, and our tympanums so
much as the ‘base bawl’ of carpet-baggers.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The host
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>of traders, capitalists, and adventurers, who had come
down during and just after the war to seek a new field
for investment in the conquered country, were, naturally,
regarded more or less as harpies. The number was
formidable, for already by the fall of 1866, between five
and ten thousand Union soldiers had settled in the State.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
The exasperating feature was that they immediately
undertook to run the government for the natives, securing
office through negro votes.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Capital, energy, and talents
were desired, but not men to tend to their politics.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Two great facts are to be remembered in the negro
question in Louisiana. In the first place the negroes were
in a slight majority. After the war the Southerner saw
his former slaves avoiding him, careless, insolent, acquiring
habits of vagrancy, manifesting little fear in indulging
their propensity for theft, believing that under the
guidance of disinterested councillors, they would soon
become landed proprietors without labor, scholars without
study, and the social equals of their former masters.
For so many years the fear of a servile insurrection had
hung over him that he instinctively tried to erect a defense
against it. The officials of the Freedmen’s Bureau
had also helped to complicate the situation. For the
most part, indiscreet army officers, often bent on their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>own fortunes, the directors managed the work in such an
inefficient manner that the planters found it an intolerable
nuisance. In the general demoralization of labor,
the Southerner turned in despair to the legislature for
relief and its impolitic response was the so-called “Black
Codes,” which subjected the negro to oppressive restrictions
not imposed upon the whites and smacked strongly
of the slave codes. But it is to be remembered that the
extremely rigorous code of this State was passed before
the dreaded holidays of 1865-6 when the negroes were
confidently expecting Uncle Sam’s gift of “forty acres
and a mule.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In the second place, the Gulf States had
an element of especially vicious negroes, due to the fact
that before the war criminals for offenses less than murder
were traditionally sold “South.” There were also more
free colored persons in Louisiana than in all the other
Southern States, negroes who were likely to have developed
some leadership and initiative,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but were on the average
less intelligent than in most of the former slave States.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Every effort was made by the radicals to encourage the
negro to claim full equality with the whites, political and
social, until by 1868 they were demanding not only the
franchise, but mixed schools, a share in public affairs and
even social rights. The Southerner, as has been said
so many times, did not hate the negro, but he did not
believe that he could rise in the scale of civilization. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>felt that most of the negroes had not sufficient intelligence
to desire the franchise, and hence that it was superimposed
upon him. Nordhoff declares that “without
whites to organize the colored vote—which means to
mass it, to excite it, to gather the voters at barbacues,
to carry them up with a hurra to the polls, to make
‘bolting’ terrible, to appeal to the fears of the ignorant and
the cupidity of the shrewd; without all this the negro
will not vote.” And it was a well-known fact that the
“organizers”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> were Federal officers with little else to do.
And, in addition, the campaigns did interfere with the
work rendered. The following passage from Nordhoff,
the words of the bitterest Democrat he met in the State,
shows how direct this was: “And they work just about
as well (as in slavery), except when some accursed politician
comes up from New Orleans with a brass band,
and sends word, as was done last fall, that General Butler
had ordered them all to turn out to a political meeting.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Nowhere, perhaps, is this sentiment more accurately
reflected than in a speech of Senator Ogden’s in the State
Assembly: “Do you not know as well as I that all the
disgust, all the anger and bitterness that arose between
these different political factions was engendered by the
ill voices of certain politicians, who haranguing the ignorant
and superstitious, in private and in public, poured
into their ears voices as poisonous as nightshade.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Negro suffrage was the burning question, and they
were not reconciled, even after it had become a fact, even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>when they consented, as they did in the fall of 1868, to
use the negro vote. But valiantly did the Democratic
party in that election turn to win them; helped them to
form clubs, promised protection, and offered to give
Democratic negroes the preference in employment, enlisted
negro orators; and often had them speak from the
same platform as white Democrats. Yet all this was but
for the purpose of securing white ascendency, for it was
in this very year that the Knights of the White Camelia
became perfected into a Federal organization, pledged to
secure white supremacy, and to prevent political power
from passing to the negro. The negro franchise might
be a fact, but, if organized effort could prevent it, negro
office-holding should not.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The Southerner felt that the
last scourge of defeat, Congressional reconstruction,
was founded on falsehood and malice. He declared that
the reports concerning outrages on negroes had been distorted
and exaggerated. The only purpose he could see
in the zeal to put the ballot in the hands of men too
ignorant to use it without direction was to prolong party
power.</p>

<p>This hostility to the negro vote led to ingenious modes
of reasoning to evade the results of the polls. On the
eve of the assembling of the legislature of 1869 one of the
city papers suggested that a certain negro Senator had
been rendered ineligible by the adoption of a new registry
law. As his ballot had been the casting vote which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>seated another negro, the latter held his seat illegally,
and the article closes with the pertinent query whether
laws made by such legislators would have any validity.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Another factor in the social problem, unique to the
South, was not absent from Louisiana—the numerous
“poor whites” in the northern part of the State. Living
close to the subsistence line on the thin soil of the pine
hills back of the bottom lands, without schools, with but
few churches, given to rude sports and crude methods of
farming, their ignorance and prejudice bred in them after
the emancipation of the negro a dread of sinking to the
social level of the blacks. The dread, in turn, bred hatred,
and it was from this class, instigated very probably by
the class above them, that the Colfax and Coushatta
murders<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> took their unfortunate rise.</p>

<p>And still one other element, mischievous in the extreme,
must be added to the social complex—men who pursued
no occupation, but preyed on black and white alike,
as gamblers and tenth-rate politicians, drinking and
swaggering at the bar, always armed with knife and
revolver, shooting negroes now and then for excitement.
This class was recruited, largely, from the descendants
of the old overseer and negro-trader of ante-bellum days.
With just enough education to enable them to dazzle
the negro by a political harangue, they were both disliked
and feared by the decent white people. According
to the testimony of a Northern observer,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the first duty of
the Republican leaders in Louisiana was “to hang them
by the dozen.” And it was just because they were not
crushed out, except so far as the respectable conservative
could combat them, that Louisiana had to endure such
a drawn-out purgatory before she was reconstructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Economically the State presented no better view.
Louisiana had suffered particularly from the war, as a part
of her soil had been held by Federal troops through a great
part of the conflict, and the plantations had been drained,
in consequence, of a large part of their labor. Taxable
property had been reduced almost two-thirds. The returning
rebel found his plantation in the worst possible
state of repair, or his title subject to dispute under the
confiscation laws, while much had been seized by treasury
agents or dishonest speculators. He turned, in the
absence of capital, labor, currency, to the one thing he
knew—the raising of cotton. Even here he had to adjust
himself to a complete change of system from fixed, forced
labor to payments at set times or planting on shares where
he was at the mercy of his planter. It cannot be charged,
on the whole, that the planter drove unjust bargains.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
If the negro suffered, it was at the hands of the poor, small
farmers, as ignorant as the negro himself. But a blighted
crop in 1866 was followed the next year by an almost
complete failure, while the Mississippi exacted the penalty
of neglected, broken levees by a devastating flood. Only
in 1868 did the planters obtain an average crop in the
great staples. Grinding necessity, as well as the remorseless
political ostracism, drove the better class into indifference
to public concerns and engrossment in their private
affairs. Moreover, ignorant, unprincipled legislation bred
a certain temporary apathy even to their own interests.</p>

<p>Already the finances of the State were in a sad condition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>Back taxes were in arrears, possibly, as was charged,
because the property owners were organized in opposition
to the existing government,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but more probably because
they were unable to pay. It did not help the situation
that few filling State positions were tax-payers.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> By
January 19, 1869, only about one-tenth of the amount of
the city taxes for the preceding year had been collected.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Inability to get in the taxes, resulted, naturally, in
inability on the part of the State to meet its obligations.
It had been found necessary in September, 1868, to levy
a special one per cent tax to provide for the payment of
the past due coupons on the bonds of the State, outstanding
warrants, certificates of indebtedness, and convention
warrants.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It was not even able to pay the interest on
current debts and so it was necessary for the legislature
early in 1869 to empower the governor and treasurer to
negotiate a loan to meet such approaching obligations.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Of course, credit had suffered in consequence until by
October, 1868, bonds were selling in the market at forty-seven
cents on the dollar. Certain levee bonds had
sunk so low at one time as to be sold for thirty and even
twenty-five cents.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> A motion offered in the House in the
session of 1869 that not less than fifty cents be accepted
is sufficiently illuminating.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Many State officials were
paid by warrants and suffered, except where the Assembly
favored the recipient, as in the case of the executive and
its own members, the loss of the difference between their
face value and the market value.</p>

<p>Loans were negotiated only with the greatest difficulty
and on exceedingly hard terms. On November 1, 1868,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>the interest on $2,000,000 of levee bonds was to fall due
without means to meet it. Hence, a new loan of $100,000
was necessary, but it was secured only for the short period
of ninety days at seven per cent with the privilege of
the purchase of one hundred of these bonds at sixty cents
by the loaner. At about the same time a commission
was sent to New York to sell 1300 State bonds. They
found a general distrust of all Southern securities, but
especially of those of Louisiana. Its bonds were not
quoted on the stock exchange, and the only offer on the
street was of a lot at fifty-two cents which found no
buyers. The commission at last had to accept fifty-one
and one quarter cents and, as a preliminary condition, had
to agree that provision should be made for the payment
of interest on all bonds due in January and February of
1869.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Naturally, such loans were secured only at great
additional expense. The ninety-day loan cost over
$3700, while the sale of the 3100 bonds mounted up to
$2213, $1000 of which went to pay the cost of the trip of
the three commissioners.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The necessity of paying by
warrant involved a loss to the State not only directly,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
but in the depression of State credit.</p>

<p>An attitude of extravagance and corruption was already
becoming apparent in the State administration.
The Senate at the close of its session in 1868 authorized
twelve committees to sit between sessions. Practically
every Senator sat on some committee and each member
drew pay for twenty-six days, amounting to $34,620.40
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>besides $15,000 for clerks.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> One committee alone drew
between $16,000 and $17,000. Money was doubly squandered
by one committee, which drew pay for its time
and pay for witnesses who were never examined.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And
one clerk is quoted as having had time to serve on three
committees and drawing warrants for four.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But this
corruption did not come to light until the Assembly had
entered upon its labors of 1869.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">A Carpet-bag Legislature in Session</p>


<p>The general character of the work done in the
Louisiana Assembly during the sessions of 1869
and 1870 was distinctly inferior; the tone of the
debate low; and the conduct paralleled only in the worst
of the reconstruction legislatures. The ignorance of the
members does not appear glaringly in the records of 1869,
for the more illiterate did not engage in the debate, certainly
did not venture upon lengthy addresses. It is
only occasionally that we are appalled by the dense
ignorance revealed, as when the colored legislator Burrel
broke out into a mass of incoherent repetitions in defense
of the St. Charles pavement bill.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The debate was distinctly partisan. The following
outburst, provoked by the debate on the militia bill, is
sufficiently suggestive:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Is it possible that men in broad daylight will say that we
should not call on the Republican party to give security to
the people? That we receive this amendment that men should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>be organized into a militia, that will call every disturbance
of the peace a “nigger insurrection”? Men should prove
that they are loyal before they can be trusted to go into the
militia. This amendment ought to be dammed by this
House. What, this democracy to be organized into a militia
to execute Andrew Johnson’s policy! This amendment is
full of deviltry.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On another occasion even the speaker stated as a good
reason why a certain bill should pass that the board to
be affected by it were all good Republicans. The bill
promptly passed.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> January 19 a cool resolution was
offered that the persons voted for in the parishes where
a fair election had been held, the twenty-six parishes where
the Democrats had had a majority being calmly ignored,
should meet to vote for President and Vice-President.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
It is significant, however, that sharply drawn as was the
party line, the sectional feeling manifested was distinctly
pro-Southern. When a measure was offered for a contribution
to a Lincoln Monument, few spoke for it, while
most felt it frankly impossible that the South could be
expected to contribute.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> On the other hand, when the
appeal to help bury the Confederate dead at Fredericksburg
came up the following session, even such a hot-headed
Unionist as Mr. McMillan spoke reverently in
advocacy of the appropriation.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>But worse than partisanship was the lack of dignity,
even frivolity, which characterized the proceedings. So
serious did this become that the speaker was frequently
forced to call the members to order for their senseless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>motions and tone of levity.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Amendments were repeatedly
refused by the chair as absurd<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and even improper.
It was proposed to add to the oath required by the school
bill, “shall take whiskey straight without regard to race,
color, or previous condition.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Some, when ordered read
to satisfy the curiosity of the House, proved even indecent.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
The greatest discourtesy on the part of one member to
another prevailed, while even the president of the Senate
was guilty of recognizing a Senator in the following undignified
way: “Well, just pitch in.” One member cried:
“I don’t know what he is going to talk about. I don’t
wish to hear him talk at all, and I therefore call for the
previous question.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Because one member read his
speech, another called out rudely, “There’s that document
again.” Or again, “I move the gentleman be allowed to
speak all night. He occupies the floor more than any
other member of this House.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Freedom of speech both
as to time and language and wordy altercations made
confusion and tumult almost the rule in both houses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>until such a remark as the following was possible: “I
hope the Sergeant-at-arms will call to his assistance a
sufficient number of the Metropolitan Police to keep
order and to see whether we cannot have silence, and
quiet, and stillness to hear what is going on,” while the
president weakly added, “It is really a shame that we
cannot have better order.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It frequently became necessary
for the chair to order the sergeant to seat obstreperous
members and to threaten public censure.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> In at least
one instance the threat was executed.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Carter even
boldly said of the speaker, “I must say that the man
who knows the facts of this case, as he said he did, and
is acquainted with the law, and then says that I am a defaulter,
is either a fool or unadulterated liar.” Then less
vehemently, “I will be square and honest and polite to
you all, but I will be hanged if I am to be bullyragged,
and I’ll be switched if I am to be ridden over by the
Speaker or anybody else.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Reprobate and scoundrel that he proved to be, Speaker
Carr<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> had a certain power of command, which made it
possible for him to control the House. Whenever he
called anyone else to the chair, the House broke into
disorder like a set of unruly schoolboys, leaving him
problems to disentangle on his return. Legislators indulged
in pranks such as withdrawing a member’s chair
while he was speaking in order that his fall should convulse
the House.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> So notorious was the disorder that one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>member acknowledged as a well-known fact that gentlemen
came from the North to see what kind of a House
they had. The speaker found it difficult to hear the
motions, while over and over again the reporter inserted
in the debates “confusion” and a statement to the effect
that, owing to the disorder, he had lost part of the speech.
The pages, who made as much noise “as a lot of young
colts, dodging about the floor, standing up, talking and
laughing all the time,” according to the speaker, added
to the disturbance.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> It would be difficult to read the
pages that record the proceedings on the 30th of January,
1869, without feeling convinced that the open bar, which
it was charged was to be found at the capitol, had had its
due effect.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The last evening closed fittingly with a mock
session, when, as the debates assure us, “the members
had a good time, and the reign of fun prevailed for a few
minutes.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Low as was the tone during the second session of the
Assembly, it degenerated even lower by the time the
Assembly gathered for the third time. Debate descended
more often to vulgarity<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and bad grammar and rhetoric
came to the surface more often.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. President, I have not expressed on none of these bills
termed political bills, but, as the gentleman who preceded
me from Orleans has not entirely represented me, I claim on
this floor the privilege. In the first place, he says we have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>elected a demagogue,—or some such word.... I say on
the other hand, if the way that he holds to that he has done
what he proposes that he should have done, it is because the
Democratic members on this floor, when some bills were
introduced in this House, opposed them bills, and they did
not become laws.... I do not know what done it, except it
was their own classes—except it was someone that stood in
the ranks in the days of old.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was of a legislature which assembled only a year
later that Eustis told his famous story: “There was a
member of Parliament brought me a letter of introduction,
and he asked me if I had any great curiosity to show him.
I told him I had—such a curiosity as he would never see
in any other civilized country, and I took him to the
legislature.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In methods of procedure gross irregularities occurred
as a result of carelessness or deliberate manipulation until
the procedure occasionally became a mere travesty of the
forms of government. Wiltz in the House charged that
he was never notified to attend a single meeting of the
Committee on the City Charter of which he was a
member.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> A bill was declared on third reading when
the House had refused to engross it and had ordered it
placed on the calendar. An interested member detected
the irregularity.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> A member of the Ways and Means
Committee charged that the revenue bill had been returned
when only two members had been present to act
on it.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> One striking offense was the extraordinary omnibus
motion put and carried amid boisterous laughter
late on the evening of February 23: “I move that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>reading of the bill be dispensed with, the bill be put upon
its first reading, the constitutional rule be suspended, the
bill be put upon its second and third readings and final
passage, the title adopted, and that the bill be sent to
the Senate for concurrence.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> One member remonstrated
at what he properly termed an “extraordinary proceeding.”
“The Governor has sent in a veto of some bills,
and in his message has given very grave reasons for so
doing. Now, sir, I want to see the bills. I don’t know
them at all. They were ordered to be printed this
morning, and now the House desires to take up those bills,
involving millions of dollars, without ever giving the
members an opportunity to make themselves acquainted
with their provisions.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Another member was excused
from voting on a bill, which he insisted on hearing read,
only after the following declaration of independence:
“I will throw myself back upon my reserved rights, and
I will not vote, and the House may take, with all respect,
the course they may think proper.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Even the speaker acted on one occasion without knowing
what the forms were carrying through, for, on the
query of a member as to the nature of the bill under debate,
he replied: “Something about taxes. The gentleman
from Orleans moves it be referred to the Committee on
Ways and Means.” It was so referred.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The powerful majority did not even manifest the
ordinary courtesies of debate to the minority, but replied
coldly to the very reasonable plea of the opposition for
more time on an important bill: “It seems to be the
disposition of the committee to work further.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> By dispensing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>with the reading of the bill and various other
devices to gain time, bills were often crowded through to
adoption at a single sitting.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Under the operation of the
previous question, debate was peremptorily cut off until
one member indignantly cried out: “It is impossible to
sit here and see the funds of the State voted away without
an opportunity to remonstrate against it.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Charges of corruption were brought against members
of the Assembly not only by the press<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and by the
leading citizens of the State, but charges were openly
brought on the floor of the House. In the debate on
the Ship Island Canal bill the remark was dropped that
some people thought there were millions of dollars in
that bill, and similar charges were made in regard to many
other bills.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> One member even boldly challenged another:
“I want to know how much the gentleman gets to support
this bill.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> That unnecessary clerks were employed
seems incontrovertible when the House decided that the
auditor might employ six clerks to do the work which
had always been performed by two or three. So notorious
became the corruption in many directions that the
House felt it obligatory to appoint committees of investigation,
even though one member contemned the charges
as beneath their dignity. The wording of one resolution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>offered in the House early in January of 1869 reveals a
whole tale: “Resolved, that the President of the Board
of Metropolitan Police be directed to furnish this House
with the names of any members who have been employed
as special officers, and under what assumed names they
drew their salaries for such services.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The debates
bring out the fact that two or, possibly, four members
were laboring under such charge.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Likewise, the House
became exercised over a complaint that members serving
on different House committees were also employed in
the custom-house and drawing a salary from each source.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The Assembly was not slow to put on foot investigations
of other bodies, for corruption seems already to have
vitiated most departments of the government and the
institutions connected with it.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Although the finances of the State were calling for the
most skillful handling, the legislative body acted without
even the most ordinary business prudence. While the
time limit for the payment of the city taxes and for the
collection of the special one per cent tax levied in September,
1868, had to be extended<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>; while the credit was so
weak that it was found necessary to enforce under penalties
the acceptance of the State warrants for licenses and
taxes by the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and Bernard;
while the State was in such straits that an annual tax
became necessary to pay the interest on bonds<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>; and
legislators were being put to the embarrassment of being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>told that the Waterworks Company had suspended the
water until they should pay their bill,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> they were voting
themselves their pay with a generous hand and squandering
State funds in sheer extravagance. They early<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
manifested anxiety for their pay, appropriating $250,000
in 1869, $500,000 in 1870, for the mileage and per diem of
members and clerks.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Their selfishness took the form in
1869 of instructing the warrant clerks to sell the warrants
at their market value in order to pay the members
in currency,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and in 1870, of giving their warrants the
preference. Their attitude toward themselves is perhaps
illuminating in explaining their actions. One member
had insisted that they ought to accept their money in
warrants, “in which form the government pays the
community,” when another angrily retorted, “I desire
to assure him of the very important fact that what we,
as the Legislature, give to the community ... is without
money and without price. They are so valuable
that the price cannot be fixed—there is no standard.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
And another member naïvely wants to know if he does not
consider the General Assembly the State. Even more
telling is the following exhortation of a member to the
House: “I would like to know if there is a great thing and
a good thing, in the name of God, why not let the Representatives
of the State of Louisiana have a hand in it.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Small extravagances helped to swell the total cost of
this Assembly to $264,278.06.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> There were certain items
in the general appropriation bill which looked unnecessarily
large. When a mere clerk of a district court received
a salary of $6,000, and the rental of a building for
a state house cost $13,000 for nine months; when the
always elastic clause for contingent expenses was stretched
to $16,000; when printing and advertising mounted up
to $183,000, the people might well begin to question and
murmur. A bit of sarcasm was unconsciously incorporated
in the printing appropriation of 1870 when a motion
to substitute $200,000 for the original $140,000, asking
some of these liberal-hearted gentlemen to open their
hearts a little wider and take in every official journal of
the State, was adopted.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The interest alone on bonds
issued to railroads is probably accurate enough, but had
reached the terrifying sum of $461,014.14. The only
spasm of economy which the House suffered during the
entire session of 1869 was really a pick at the police,
when a few minor officials were struck off or reduced in
salary.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The law which was to provide the income seemed to
bear no relation to the expenditures. Unwisely wasting
their time on a bill to enforce collection of taxes already
paid to the Confederacy,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> they rushed the revenue bill
through with a haste which explains its inadequacy.
Urged by the Committee on Ways and Means to accept
its work as complete, even the reading was dispensed with,
and the act, which was referred to in a later session as a
disgrace,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> adopted by the House without discussion on
the evening of March 3.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> A clause which provoked the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>greatest criticism was one licensing gambling-houses,
which appeared in the published bill and came up for a
perfect storm of debate in the session of 1870. The
chairman of the committee stated that it had not been in
the original law, and that he believed it had been surreptitiously
introduced after it had been acted upon by
the House.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Moreover, a bill which made no provision
for the interest on the debt, which made an appropriation
for an institution which did not exist,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and which
failed to meet the liabilities of the State by $500,000,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
indicated business financiering which sooner or later
must bring the State to bankruptcy.</p>

<p>And just when the finances called for a policy of retrenchment
was the time when the legislature saw fit to
embark on a system of extensive internal improvements.
As has been remarked by many reconstruction writers,
there was a conscious purpose to introduce in the South
the energy and methods of the North and West in the
hope of similar economic results. It was recognized by
the conservatives that introduction of new railroads was
necessary for economic rehabilitation. But it must not
be forgotten that the sable statesmen who were called
upon to ponder problems of high finance were ex-slaves
who had had the experience of a porter’s tips or the extra
half-dollars of a plantation hand. Of the numerous
bills of that nature introduced, a considerable number
passed, lending State aid with a liberal hand.</p>

<p>The enterprises were chiefly of three kinds: canals,
railroads, and the ever-pressing levees. The Mississippi
and Mexican Gulf Ship Canal Company profited by this
spirit to the extent of $600,000, issued in the form of State
bonds under a first mortgage, running the generous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>period of thirty years<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>; the New Orleans and Ship Island
Canal Company to the extent of $2,000,000 and a large
bonus in lands.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The House did not find it necessary
to debate at any great length the measure which legislated
away the former sum,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> but far otherwise was the history
of the latter act. Introduced into the session of 1868,
it had been thoroughly discussed in the Senate and passed
by that body and came up in the House in 1869 as unfinished
business. Its objectionable features had not
been so clear while passing the Senate, but by the next
session it had been thoroughly aired by the press.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> It
declared the system of the Drainage Commissioners of
the Metropolitan District “erroneous in principle and
unsuccessful from experience,” and so gave over into the
possession of the new Canal Company all the funds and
assets of the commissioners to the amount of nearly
$2,000,000 and public lands in installments to the extent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>of 400,000 acres, on the ground that this canal would
accomplish the drainage of the entire district. As this
fund had been raised by assessment for the special purpose
of drainage, the opposition held that it could not thus be
diverted. But, nevertheless, this bill was pressed through
the House January 29,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> under heated personal debate,
extending through several days, and after having suffered
much amendment. Although vetoed by the governor,
it passed both houses with the requisite majority March
2.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Smaller sums were donated to minor enterprises,
as $50,000 for the improvement of Loggy Bayou; $20,000
for improving Bayou Vermilion<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>; and $80,000 worth of
credit loaned to the Bœuf and Crocodile Navigation
Company.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Aid to railroads was equally liberal. In its zeal the
House on February 23, without the reading of the bill,
pushed through all its stages the incorporation of the
Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad Company, granted
it exemption from taxation for ten years, a right of way
three hundred feet in width, and the privilege of all the
timber for one mile on each side of the road through
the public lands.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> But of all the railroad bills, by far the
most conspicuous was that which extended a helping
hand to the New Orleans, Mobile, and Chattanooga
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>Road. It came up in the House February 4 and was
pressed to a final vote that very afternoon and its amendments
concurred in by the Senate February 14.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The
bill provided for the guarantee of the company’s bonds
by the State under the security of a second mortgage
to the amount of $12,500 for each mile within the State
west of New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Parishes along the route of the
Vicksburg Railroad were encouraged to aid that road by
the purchase of stock or the issue of bonds, in addition
to the State guarantee of its second mortgage bonds to the
usual amount of $12,500 per mile.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Still other roads had
found it worth while to besiege the legislature.</p>

<p>The great problem of improvement most urgently
pressing was not adequately met—the construction of a
satisfactory series of levees for the Mississippi River.
A State loan of $4,000,000 had been provided for in 1867
for that purpose but the bonds had not been readily disposed
of.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The Board of Levee Commissioners had made
contracts for a large amount of work but the legislature
of 1869 found no work accomplished—only the bonds of
the State pledged for work authorized to be done—and
so was placed under the necessity of authorizing the sale
of the bonds.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The House made a valiant effort to meet
the problem in the passage of a bill to issue bonds to the
sum of $5,000,000 to provide means for the construction,
repairs, and maintenance of the levees and other works
of improvement, but the effort died there.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>A lack of discrimination characterized the action of
the Assembly on this subject. To aid all projects just
because they savored of prosperity would seem to express
the attitude of some thoughtless legislators. “I am glad
that I have one more chance for internal improvement,”
generously declared one member.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Again, a project for the
northern part of the State was advocated that no charge
of partiality to the Southern part should be brought.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Nor is it fair to lay all the burden of debt arising from
these grants of aid at the door of the radicals. It was
rather a response to a universal desire for an extension of
railroads and improvement of the waterways of the
State, voiced by the moderate conservative press as well
as the radical. “It is noteworthy as a sign fraught
with good promise,” says the <i>Commercial Bulletin</i>, “that
the railroad spirit is alive in the Northern parishes of this
State, and that those whom it inspires are evidently
bent on the early accomplishment of substantial results.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
In like strain the <i>Crescent</i> concerning the work of the
Chattanooga Railroad: “It is certainly to be hoped that
we shall soon have direct railroad communications with
Mobile, and that all efforts to prevent the consummation
of so desirable an object will fail.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> But the <i>Picayune</i>,
while on the whole encouraging the measures, was more
conservative and urged that promises of aid be few,
“unless they are of certain and undoubted practicability
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>and profitableness, and are secure beyond all peril of
loss.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Such measures were supported by members of
both parties, often introduced by Democrats, in every
case supported by a large majority of Democrats in both
houses.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The leading movers, outside of the legislature,
of these bills were men of both parties; and the lobbyists
who advanced the corrupt measures were of both faiths.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
This fact was admitted by the Democratic press.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The legislature of 1869, with which the <i>Commercial
Bulletin</i> sourly assured its readers the people wanted as
little as possible to do, convened January 4 and sat
until March 4. The governor’s annual message to it,
a plea for freedom from prejudice, struck a tone of optimism
which subsequent events did not justify: “The
issues of the past eight years have been settled, we hope,
forever. Slavery has been swept away, and along with
it all the train of evils growing out of its wickedness, and
has left us—master and slave, white and black—with the
same rights under the law, the same chance to succeed in
life, and with equally unrestricted aspirations and hopes.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>He professed faith in a “wise, economical, moderate,
and firm administration of the nation and the State as
curing animosities and bringing prosperity to the people.”
That portion of his message which alluded to the
violence of 1868 and to his measures to allay the
excitement was severely challenged by the Democratic
press.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The Assembly during the two months of its existence
passed 152 laws, many of which were local, many personal
relief bills.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> There was beginning to be apparent that
tendency to vest autocratic power in the hands of the
governor, which reached, as we shall see, such a culmination
in the next session. In some instances, it is true,
the propositions could not muster sufficient strength to
pass the Assembly, but it is significant that such propositions
could be offered as Ray’s amendment to the charter
bill for New Orleans, which suggested vesting in the
Governor power to appoint the first mayor and council
until the election in 1872, and the amendment to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>volunteer militia bill, which left to him large discretionary
powers.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The act which prohibited the mayor of
New Orleans from exercising any police duty or authority
is equivalent to an enlargement of the governor’s powers,
for the body with such control, the metropolitan police,
was virtually his servant through his appointive power.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
Quite as important was the negative action of the Assembly
in refusing to force the governor to order elections in
certain cases where for political reasons he was leaving
vacancies.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>One group of laws attempted to deal with the race and
labor questions. A vagrancy law, which finally overcame
the hostile majority in the Senate, while not so severe as
those of the “Black Code,” did still define rather narrowly
and imposed heavy penalties.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> This stringency arose,
at least largely, from the need of labor and devotion to
the crops to which economic conditions forced the planters.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
A measure to organize a Bureau of Immigration was
passed, appropriating $20,000 to secure a share in the
foreign labor which they saw flooding the North. Unfortunately,
this did not solve the labor problem, and dissatisfaction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>with the Bureau,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and especially with its
carpet-bagger chief, J. O. Noyes, was loudly voiced in
the session of 1870. Efforts to secure new workers by
legislation continued throughout the next session. A
bill to accord negroes equal civil rights had been up in
the session of 1868 but had not been signed by the governor,
who was forced to explain to a body of their race
assembled en masse, February 4, 1869, his reasons for
not doing so.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> And Pinchback’s civil rights bill, which
forbade common carriers and places of public resort to
discriminate on account of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> came up as unfinished business from
the preceding session. As was to be expected, feeling
ran high and lengthy discussion resulted, usually of a
serious character. Twenty-six Senators were reported
as desirous of speaking on the bill. Pinchback in debate
made use of the expression “refused a drink of common
whiskey in a common grog-shop,” which was seized on
by the conservative press as a convenient whip. The
cry of the Conservatives was that the colored people had
too much sense to force themselves where they were not
wanted, and this view was borne out by the negroes themselves.
“I consider myself just as far above coming
into company that does not want me, as they are above
my coming into an elevation with them.... I do not
believe that any sensible colored man upon this floor
would wish to be in a private part of a public place without
the consent of the owners of it. It is false; it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>wholesale falsehood to say that we wish to force ourselves
upon white people.” But he did insist that they receive
equal accommodation.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The former set down the agitation
to a political move to renew the strife.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>When the bill had passed both houses, the press took a
more aggressive attitude in an effort to frighten the
negroes from any attempt to claim their rights. “Will
any negro, or gang of negroes, attempt to exercise the
privilege it confers?” belligerently asked the <i>Commercial
Bulletin</i>. “If they do, it will be at their peril.... He
may be able to obtain a ticket of admission, but no New
Orleans audience will ever permit him to take his seat
except in the places allotted for colored persons.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The
<i>Bee</i> declared that if the governor dared to sign that bill
after vetoing the former, “legal means would not be
lacking to set aside this arbitrary law, this outrage to the
law of propriety, and to individual liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The civil rights bill was backed up by a measure
intended to prevent the intimidation of negroes by punishing
the bribery of witnesses or preventing a witness by
force, threat, or intimidation from testifying in a criminal
proceeding.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> It is striking that a Ku-Klux bill—a bill
“to prevent people from agoing abroad disguised”—was
quickly referred and evidently died in committee.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>effort in the next session to prevent the carrying of
concealed weapons met no better fate.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>A measure allied to the above legislation, but of vastly
greater importance because of its National character, was
the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which was
accepted perfunctorily by a vote of 18 to 3 in the Senate;
59<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> to 9 in the House, 36 Republicans refusing to vote.</p>

<p>Particularly confusing were the various measures which
finally evolved into the slaughter house bill. Vigorous
opposition and much ridicule manifested themselves at
its first appearance in the House, but all amendments
against the monopolistic features were voted down, debate
choked off abruptly, all attempts at filibustering
defeated, and the bill adopted by a large majority under
the operation of the previous question.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Scanty indeed
is the record of its history in the Senate. “After a short
fight the bill was concurred in as a whole and the motion
to reconsider tabled by a vote of 23 to 9.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> By it the slaughter
of animals, except by the Crescent City Live Stock
Landing and Slaughter House Company was prohibited
within the city of New Orleans or the parishes of Orleans,
Jefferson, and St. Bernard after June 1, 1869. All animals
destined for sale or slaughter must be landed at the live
stock landings and yards of the company, occupying the
levee from Common to Poydras streets, which naturally
exacted a fee for each steamship and craft landing at its
wharves.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The excessive haste with which the bill was
rushed through was pretty generally believed to be due
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>to the fact that legislators had bought stock with the
privilege of paying at convenience.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> A perfect hue and
cry against monopoly and violation of private rights
went up at the passage of this bill. Hear the <i>Bee</i>: “So
the bill has passed, just as it came from the House, and
with provisions so monstrously unjust that if it be not
arrested by veto, and be subjected to an ordeal by the
two Houses, in review, which it is believed it cannot survive,
it will at least become a byword of reproach to all
concerned in it.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Or the <i>Picayune</i>: “Nay, monopolies
have themselves such elements of corruption and are so
odious in the land that they can and will be set aside. It
may take time and a reformation of the polluted courts of
justice to bring this about, but it will be done when the
people awake to the necessity of driving the money-changers
and the false Scribes and Pharisees from the
temple.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>As there were about one thousand persons employed
in the business in the parishes concerned, the effect was
broad-spread. The butchers held a meeting immediately
to consult on the best plan to defeat the bill<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and organized
an association on July 21. Some hundreds of suits
were brought in the various district courts on the one side
or the other, sometimes in combinations, sometimes by
individuals. The ground of this opposition was that
the act created a monopoly and was a violation of the
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and of the
Louisiana Bill of Rights. The Sixth District Court held
the law unconstitutional, while in the Fifth, in which
the new company had instituted suit against the association,
the verdict was in favor of the company. Appeals
from these several decisions came before the State Supreme
Court by what is there known as “suspensive appeals,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>but the decision was not rendered until April 11, 1870,
when the rights of the new company were upheld. In
course of time,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> the cases came before the Supreme Court
of the United States when the decision of the State court
was sustained on the ground of police regulation, “a
power incapable of any very exact definition or limitation.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

be true.” Quoted from the <i>Crescent</i> in a Congressional document.</p>

aborde les affaires sérieuses.” Jan. 5. The <i>Abeille</i> or <i>Bee</i> had English

excerpts.</p>

<p>The <i>Crescent</i> was no more kindly: “This portion of the message is
strictly and narrowly partisan, a tissue of bold, unqualified assertions and
of self-evident exaggerations which would be indecent even in a campaign
document; a weak but spiteful jumble of accusatory phrases in which
there is but a single pretense to an argument, and that so puerile and
idiotic in its fallacy as to be simply ridiculous.” Jan. 5.</p>

<p>“The Governor applies harsh terms to our people. He attributes to
them all the violence which may have existed in the State. Does he
really think that he himself and his associates have had nothing to do with
this excitement? Have the publications made by Republican papers,
speakers, and writers contributed nothing to these troubles?” New

<p class="ph3">The Climax of Warmothism</p>


<p>The question of the governor’s power of appointment<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
involved two serious conflicts with municipalities
during 1869, from one of which, at least,
Warmoth emerged victoriously. A law of 1868 provided
for the filling of all vacancies of State or parish offices by
appointment for the remainder of the term by the governor
with the consent of the Senate, but by the Governor
alone, if the Senate were not in session, the appointment
to expire the third Monday after the next session of the
Assembly.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Governor Warmoth chose to interpret this
as giving him the appointment even when the vacancy
occurred by the expiration of the term of office. In 1868
the legislature had amended the charter of Jefferson City,
requiring an election on the first Monday of January,
1869, and every two years thereafter for mayor, treasurer,
comptroller, and aldermen.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Section 4 also provided
that the governor should remove the existing aldermen
and officers and appoint others until new incumbents
should be elected. Warmoth did not execute this portion
of the law but allowed matters to remain as they
were until January, 1869, when an election should have
been held. But none was ordered, instead of which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>governor proceeded the following May to appoint, as
in case of a vacancy. The original mayor, Kreider,
refused to yield office, and so the appointee applied to
the district judge for a mandamus to require the delivery
of the books, which was granted. The new board was
installed May 19, by aid of the metropolitan police.
This action called out some violent demonstrations on
the part of the citizens but no serious disturbance resulted
and it was decided to leave the matter to the courts.
Kreider carried an appeal to the Supreme Court, which held
that the term of the occupants in office had not expired,
for the failure to hold an election did not vacate the office.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The case of New Orleans was analogous. The term of
office of one-half of the Council had expired; and a special
election was held May 19 to fill the vacancies. But
the governor under his unique interpretation of the law
made appointments to fill them. The old board claimed
that there were no vacancies, as, according to law, they
were to hold their offices until their successors were duly
elected and qualified; namely, until the next regular
election. In this form it went to the courts on July 19.
A three-cornered comedy of injunctions took place; one,
granted by Judge Collins, admitted the newly elected
members to their seats; a second, by Judge Leaumont,
placed the governor’s appointees in office and a Democratic
howl went up; a third, from Judge Cooley, restored
the elected members, and a Republican howl went up,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> but
this latter injunction was dissolved December 25.
Appeal was taken from the decision of Judge Leaumont
to the Supreme Court by the city of New Orleans, but
was dismissed November 19, because of a technicality.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>At the close of the year, the Governor decided to use the
“mailed fist.” December 28 the sheriff of the Fifth District
Court read an order before the council to exclude
certain members and install the appointees of Warmoth.
The approaches to the council-room were crowded. The
board decided to obey under protest and the governor’s
<i>protégés</i> were seated and proceeded to organize. One old
member stayed in his seat, but as he made himself somewhat
troublesome, he was ejected and another with a
commission seated. In the other chamber of the city
council that same evening one of the appointees appeared
within the bar. President Wiltz ordered him put out.
After adjournment the sheriff entered the chamber and
read the above-mentioned order of Judge Leaumont.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
On December 30 the sheriff of the Sixth District Court
called the names of the appointees and served a paper
upon each from the elected members. But the attorney
advised obedience to the orders of the Fifth District Court
and with this action the governor remained triumphant.</p>

<p>The wrangle between the governor and Wickliffe, the
auditor of public accounts, which extended during most
of 1869 and up until March of the new year, resulted in a
victory for the former. He accused Wickliffe of extortion
and corruption and had him arrested on several
specific charges. Fourteen indictments for malfeasance
to the amount of $1800 were found by the grand jury.
While awaiting the trial, the governor suspended Wickliffe
and appointed L. T. Delassize, a wealthy negro,
auditor <i>ad interim</i>, installing him by the aid of the metropolitan
police. But Wickliffe, nothing daunted, gave
notice through the papers that he had opened his office
at No. 53 Conti Street, “opposite where the Auditor’s
office formerly was,” and warned the public not to pay
taxes or transact any business with the bureau until the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>auditor could retake possession of his office.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> A war
of injunctions followed: a writ from the Seventh District
Court prohibited Delassize from performing his duties
on the ground that the governor had no power to make
the appointment; a counter injunction from the Fifth
District Court, March 29, restrained Wickliffe from acting.
This conflict in jurisdiction went before the Supreme
Court,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> but before a decision could be rendered, two of
the criminal cases came up for trial, in both of which
Wickliffe was acquitted, but in the one case the judge
considered it necessary to dismiss the jury with a reprimand.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
The remainder of the charges were dismissed
by the attorney-general on the ground that the auditor
could not be tried until after impeachment. Party
feeling ran high in the press concerning the controversy,
some Democratic papers coming out emphatically for
Wickliffe, due possibly to mere opposition to the governor.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
The governor withdrew his opposition and allowed
Wickliffe to resume office. In December the auditor decided
to move his archives at night into the building used
as a state house, but the governor on the 30th had his
effects removed from Mechanics Institute to the sidewalk.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>But this fact created no excitement in the city, as the
affair seems still to have been regarded as a petty, personal
squabble.</p>

<p>In this shape the matter came before the General Assembly
in 1870. Rumors of impeachment had been rife,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
and even before the governor’s message was sent in, a
resolution had been adopted by the House for a joint
committee to examine into the affairs of the auditor’s
office and the action of the governor in suspending the
auditor.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In the special message promised by the
governor in his annual address, he charged that the auditor’s
offenses had seriously embarrassed the government
and rendered it difficult to pay the interest on the State
bonds. He specifically accused him of extortion against
individuals and the charitable institutions of the State,
and of fraud against the Commonwealth and collusion
with evil-minded persons.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The special committee of
the House, to which the message was referred, offered
on January 31 a resolution of impeachment which was
debated at some length and adopted on the evening of
February 1 with but five dissenting votes.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The seriousness
of the question sobered the Assembly so that the
proceedings were marked throughout the trial by a dignity
and decorum sadly wanting in their other discussions.
Articles of impeachment were ordered prepared and the
act suspending him from office became effective by the
prompt concurrence of the Senate on February 4.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>February 3, Wickliffe brought thirty-four distinct
counter charges against Warmoth of violations of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>constitution and laws, of frauds upon the treasury,
charges of corruption in levying blackmail upon citizens,
of bribery of witnesses, and numerous other acts of malfeasance.
“In short,” the accusation concludes, “his
conduct in this respect is so notorious that it can be
proved that he never signed a bill of pecuniary benefit to
anyone that he did not demand and receive money or
other consideration for his signature.”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> He summed
up the frauds to the State to the grand total of
$800,000 and “untold millions from forgery.” But the
only effect this venting of his spleen had upon Warmoth’s
loyal vassals was to cause an investigation to be made
which enabled Warmoth to go before the people exonerated
by an official inquiry.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The House preferred twenty-eight articles of impeachment
against Wickliffe, most of them for exacting bribes
to issue his warrants for money appropriated for printing
and charitable institutions, and for exceeding the
appropriations.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The trial began February 14, and continued
almost daily until the close of the session, when
on the evening of March 3, the Senate found him guilty
upon the fourth article by unanimous vote.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> A resolution
removing him permanently from office followed
immediately. At the last moment he tried to escape
sentence by resigning,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and by fleeing from the State,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
but the Senate proceeded calmly to ignore such cowardice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>and to vote him out of office. Whatever may be the
fact as to Wickliffe’s dishonesty, he was clearly guilty
of gross irregularity and carelessness in the keeping of
his records.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> And the governor had demonstrated to
the State that his hold on the legislature was sufficiently
firm to enable him to crush a presumptuous
subordinate.</p>

<p>The legislation of 1870 marks high tide in Warmoth’s
power. The rudder he held firmly in his hands for almost
two years longer; but against an ever-increasing wave of
opposition, it became constantly more difficult to steer
in the direction he would. Because of friction within
his own ranks, legislation did not again, after 1870, become
the mouthpiece for promulgating his decrees.</p>

<p>There were, in reality, two sessions, but the extra session
followed so closely on the heels of the first, and so
much of the work was but the completion of the unfinished
business of the first session, that for purposes of convenience
the legislation will be treated as emanating from
one body. The Assembly convened for the first session
at noon, January 3. After a slight struggle over the
speakership in the House, Mr. Carr of Orleans was elected
and the House reported itself ready for the governor’s
message. Its congratulatory tone sounds a bit forced
when he felicitates his people upon “the good feeling
that exists among the people of both races”; and the
cheerfulness with which they are accepting the new order
of things, and the earnestness with which “our people
are addressing themselves to further protect the great
interests committed to their hands.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> But it is taken
up, for the most part, with a businesslike discussion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>the various measures which, in his estimation, called
for action: encouragement of immigration, the finances,
levees, public improvements, emendation of the school law
of 1869, charities, and gambling-houses.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>For the first time we hear the note of caution in regard
to the financial condition. The governor warned the
Assembly that it was not satisfactory and was such as to
embarrass his administration. He admitted that the
credit of the State had not always been used for practicable
purposes, but insisted that under proper checks it might
be safely used to a still greater extent.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The usual
expedients were again resorted to: loans were negotiated
to meet the interest due; and the floating debt was provided
for by the issue or exchange of fresh bonds. But
the same extravagance and folly which characterized
their actions in 1869 continued undiminished.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>By the session of 1870 an old feature of parliamentary
tactics was introduced: the opposition, though unavailing
as to the final vote, had become thoroughly organized for
filibustering purposes and threats of recourse to its use
were held over the heads of the radicals as a whip.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Mr.
Lowell proposed once to make a bargain with his party,
to which he was opposed on a particular bill, by exchanging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>his filibustering advantage for a grant of time.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> By
debates on rules of order, appeals from the chair to the
House, demands for the roll-call on every little insignificant
vote, they were able to waste time and wear out
their opponents until practically no business was done
at certain sessions.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Four of the five measures which were destined to become
the most important of the session—indeed of the
reconstruction period in Louisiana—and the storm center
about which the opposition to the governor gathered,
were, together with the appropriation and revenue bills,
introduced into the Senate as early as the third day, thus
gaining for that active body the questionable distinction
of initiative.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Nor did that body lose its zeal in pushing
legislation, for toward the close of the session bills went
through with a haste amazing even after the facility
displayed on occasion in 1869. At a single evening session
twenty bills were acted on,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and yet, despite regular
night sessions for about two weeks, the session approached
its close without concluding much important legislation,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
and without making provision for the revenues or expenses
of the government. And so, in accordance with the
general expectation,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> the governor on March 3 notified
the two houses of the necessity to reassemble March 7
for ten days. In this extra session the Assembly took
up and passed the tremendous number of ninety-eight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>bills, as compared with one hundred and seven in the first
session.</p>

<p>An effort to tackle the problem of the government of
New Orleans had suffered indefinite postponement at
the end of the session of 1869. Both houses introduced
bills early in 1870, but it was only late in the extra session,
after lengthy, heated debate, numerous amendments, and
the creation of committees of conference, that the two
houses could agree upon a measure which consolidated
Jefferson City with New Orleans, forced through by the
country members, it was vehemently declared, against
the vigorous opposition of the city members. The
smaller city did not want to be saddled with the debt
and taxes of the larger. A representative of Jefferson
said: “I say, sir, here in my place, that the people—the
masses—do not want to be forced to pay an additional
2½ per cent tax.... There are not 150 people in
Jefferson who would vote for consolidation.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> An amendment
to submit it to popular vote was undemocratically
voted down. The enlarged city was to be governed by a
mayor and seven administrators, presiding over as many
departments, who were to constitute the city council.
Vacancies in these offices were to be filled by appointment
by the governor prior to January 1, 1871, and
subsequently by popular election.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>New Orleans was one of the few Southern cities which
had had a system of public schools before the war. Even
in 1865 there were 141 schools for freedmen and 19,000
pupils, the result of a free system for twenty-five years.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
A school law, providing in great detail for the public
education of all persons between six and twenty-one
years of age “without distinction of race or color” had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>been passed in 1869. But it had been a failure,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> proving
in the governor’s words, “cumbrous and expensive.”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
The governor, therefore, suggested that the plan be
simplified, the districts enlarged, and the powers and discretion
of the State board increased.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Shortly after the
opening of the session a bill was reported in the House
and received, despite attempts to choke it, full, heated
discussion and amendment, section by section, passing
only on February 10.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In the Senate it came up for a
lengthy debate on the last evening, when it was crowded
out by the pressure of business so that it had to go over
to March 9 and 10 in the extra days of grace when,
somewhat amended, it passed by a very large majority, the
dissenting votes coming from the city members.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The
House concurred in the Senate amendments the next day.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this bill the State was divided into
six divisions, of which New Orleans formed one. The
State superintendent was required to nominate to the
governor, and the governor to the Senate, a superintendent
for each division to hold office three years. The
division superintendents with the State superintendent
as president constituted a board, having the general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>supervision and control of the public schools throughout
the State, while the division superintendents were to
have full control in their respective divisions. The
system of New Orleans was connected with that of the
State by the selection of a city board of directors by
the State board, thus repealing all laws granting control to
the municipal authorities of that city. The State board
was also to appoint a board for every town, city, and parish
in the State with full corporate powers to sue and be sued.
The general school tax was fixed at two mills on the
dollar in addition to a tax of two mills to be collected in
each parish. It continued, however, the provision for
the admission of all children between the ages of six
and twenty-one to the schools.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>A special civil court, the Eighth District Court, created
at the special session, proved of transcendent importance,
when supported by the criminal court,—created several
sessions earlier. The two had jurisdiction over all public
matters, while the power of appointing the judges was
vested in the governor, thus circumventing the constitution.
All cases of a public character, contests for office,
writs of quo warranto, injunctions, mandamus had to
be submitted to the former court, to which all cases then
pending before other district courts must immediately
be transferred.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Numerous petitions to the legislature of 1870 showed
that the idea of improvements had now seized upon a
large number of the constituents as well as legislators.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Not only did members now propose to raise the State to
economic glory through the ordinary avenue of new railroads
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>and navigable bayous, but in their enthusiasm they
were willing to legislate parks<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and factories into existence
and to develop the mineral resources of the State by
the same agency. Bayou Bartholomew was now to be
improved; the New Orleans and Chattanooga Railroad
boosted by State bonds<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>; and a large sum of stock
subscribed in the Mississippi Valley Navigation Company.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>A number of amendments to the constitution were
offered this session,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> but only four mustered sufficient
strength to pass both houses. The most noted were
the one which removed the governor’s ineligibility for
a second term<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and the amendment to Article 99, which
removed the last restriction on the ex-rebels. It had
been offered in the Assembly, both in 1868 and 1869,
and the governor had urged it in his annual message in
the latter year.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> It stands out in pleasing relief to most
of the partisan legislation of that period, inasmuch as it
was introduced, we are told in debate, by one of the most
bitter opponents of the Democrats,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> aroused very little
debate, and passed almost unanimously in both houses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>at a single sitting.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Several speeches, all in favor, were
made by negroes to give, as one of them innocently said,
“a little coloring to the matter.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>A third amendment was intended to secure the safety
of the public funds,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and the fourth was a most important
restriction on the public debt, namely, that prior to
January 1, 1890, it could not be increased beyond
$25,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>But certain bills were of such transcendent importance
that they all but effaced the consciousness of
other legislation, at least in the mind of the public.
These were the four great bills, the election, registration,
constabulary, and militia bills, which, together
with the constitutional amendment which
removed ineligibility for a second gubernatorial term,
made it possible for Governor Warmoth to determine
the personnel of all offices practically at will, and,
but for the stumbling-block of the nominating convention,
to continue himself indefinitely at the head
of affairs.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the distrust of the governor
in the State at large—and complaints were not wanting
from the first in Democratic circles—confidence in their
young leader was unshaken in the men who constituted
this Assembly. Even when opposing individual bills,
members were careful to express confidence in Warmoth<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>in some such terms as follows: “Not that I have
anything against the governor himself, but I think it
improper to give such extraordinary power to any man,
were he an apostle.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>These measures were introduced together, as has been
stated, on the third day, and action on them extended
during the entire period up to the very close of the extra
session. The greatest effort of the opposition was expended
on the election bill. This was not a new conception
of 1870, for a strenuous effort to press through
such a bill under cover of the excitement of the closing
days of the session of 1869 had failed. The note of alarm
was sounded almost as soon as this bill was reported to
the Senate by the Judiciary Committee.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> “Now, sir,
here is a bill giving the governor more than imperial power—behind
it is concealed an armed Grecian horse, with
which he may ride over the rights of the people....”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Debate raged every day from January 18 to 24. The
party aspect of the bill was so evident that it was assailed
at once as a device to perpetuate the Republican party
in power.</p>

<p>“I believe,” declared one member, “the only persons
belonging to this State who desire this enactment are those
in office, and who are afraid that unless such a bill as this
is passed, they will not retain the positions they now
occupy, and this fear, Mr. President, is not based on any
fraud or violence that might occur at the next election in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>which they might become candidates, but in the simple
fact that a revolution has taken place in public opinion.”<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Even a Republican felt obliged to break from his party
because of its objectionable features.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Feeling reached a perfect climax of frenzy and sank
to depths of despondency for which it was difficult to find
language sufficiently vehement.</p>

<p>“Therefore, I hope you will believe me when I tell you
that this is the snake in the grass—the form that the devil
himself assumed when he seduced our mother Eve. I tell
you that this is a devil, covered and concealed perhaps,
under perfumed flowers, but nevertheless, the devil—his
tail and horn comes out, and not only his tail, but his
horns and hoof. I tell you that this bill is a devil of a
bill—the concocters are devilish fellows, and the only way
we can destroy their sulphuric power is to give them hell.”<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
Another outburst was clothed in more funereal garb:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe really that if ever there has come a day to the State
of Louisiana when the whole edifice of her political government
ought to be draped in mourning, that day has come now.
I believe if ever there has come a day when all the pomp and
glory of the past had forsaken her—widowed as she is in
affection, destitute of all those glorious sympathies that used
to awaken a nobler people—we have arrived, unfortunately
for us, at that miserable period.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In his excitement one member cried: “By God! I
do not vote when they are passing bills here to take
away the lifeblood of the people.”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans rested their defense on the necessity
of an election law which would secure to every citizen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>entitled to vote a free exercise of his rights.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> They
turned the debate on the Democrats by declaring that
if they could not carry an election without violence and
were unwilling to pass a law to insure a fair election, they
did not want an honest vote.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Radicals who were not
satisfied with the bill declared that the opposition by their
refusal to discuss it fairly and by filibustering had prevented
any modification. The attitude of the mulatto
leader, Pinchback, was that it was the lesser of two evils.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
It reëmerged from a special committee, to which it had
been committed, January 24,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and which again submitted
a majority and minority report, for a second period of
debate from January 27 to 31, on which latter date,
much amended and fought to the bitter end, it was
adopted by a vote of 20 to 12.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>It came before the House on February 4, where it was
argued at length from February 11 to 16, in keen,
searching debate. Members did not scruple to speak
plainly: “This bill, as I believe it, and as I know it, makes
the Republican party dominant; it makes the Governor,—not
clearly, but tacitly—all power; it makes the many
parishes of this State but fiefs of the Executive. It adds
one more power to those he is already endowed with.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
Note the succinct condemnation of it as a party measure
in the following query: “Why is the whole State outlawed
in consequence of the misbehavior of portions of it?
Outlawed, I say, for it provides for the outlawry of those
who refuse to vote a Republican ticket.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Party feeling
ran as high as in the other House, and members found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>threatening documents on their desks, placed there,
Republicans declared, by the Ku-Klux.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Finally, suffering
much amendment here too, it was passed February
18 immediately after prayer, with a burst of party effort:
with the reading of only thirteen sections,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> the passage
of the bill as a whole was moved and carried, the reading
of more than fifty sections being thus suppressed, notwithstanding
the protest of the Democrats at the unconstitutional
manner in which it was passed.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> February
19 the Senate concurred in the House amendments.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>The other measures seem almost to have turned on the
fate of the election law, for the opposition evidently
exhausted its great effort on that bill. There was little
heat over the other measures; little filibustering, few long
speeches. Such few members as spoke seemed to do so
to discharge a moral duty.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The registration bill passed
the Senate, February 9<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> without amendment and the
House entirely without debate on the last evening of the
regular session.</p>

<p>The history of the militia bill in the House was truly remarkable.
It was introduced March 9 from the Senate,
where the interest was so slight that only seven Senators
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>were present to register their vote against the fourteen
votes which carried it<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>; the necessity of considering it in
Committee of the Whole was dispensed with, and it was
hurried to its third reading. The story of its passage on
the evening of March 14 is told in the following brief
passage from the debates:</p>

<p>“Chief Clerk Vigers read the bill.</p>

<p>“I move its final passage, and on that call the previous
question.</p>

<p>“The Speaker put the question on the final passage <i>viva
voce</i>, and it was declared carried.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>This action caused the greatest confusion, surprise, and
protest.</p>

<p>The registration bill threw into the control of the governor
the power to declare who should vote, as the election
bill allowed him to declare for whom the votes were cast.
With the consent of the Senate he was to appoint a State
registrar, and one supervisor in each parish—except
Orleans, where the State registrar was to serve—whose
duty it should be to cause every qualified voter to be
registered and make out lists of the registered voters for
the commissioners of election at each polling-place.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
The decision of any supervisor was final. Courts were
prohibited from interfering in any way with him or his
assistants. The supervisors, in turn, appointed three
commissioners of election at each poll.</p>

<p>The election bill vested in the governor power to take
all necessary steps to secure a fair, free, and peaceable
election; and gave him on election day paramount charge
and control of the peace and order of the State, over all
peace and police officers, and over all sheriffs and constables.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>Parish and district judges were forbidden to issue writs
of mandamus or injunction or other order to compel a
commissioner of election to do his duty, as the latter was
to be responsible only to the supervisor and he to the
governor. On election day citizens at large were expressly
forbidden to carry arms except under orders of the executive
or his appointees. In all parishes except Orleans,
the duty and function of sheriffs were superseded by men
appointed by the governor. The governor and his officers
were to be able to withhold certificates of election to the
General Assembly whenever in their discretion they might
see fit, in all cases where fraud, violence, bribery, or other
irregularity might be reported. The capstone of the
structure, as it has been aptly called, was the returning-board,
consisting of the governor, lieutenant-governor,
secretary of State, and two Senators indicated by name—John
Lynch and T. C. Anderson,—in whom was vested
the entire revisory power. They were empowered to fill
vacancies within their own number by a majority vote.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>In order fully to comprehend the opportunity for fraud
in elections, it must also be noted that the State constitution
gave the right to vote in any parish or in any part of
a parish after a residence of ten days, so that a man,
armed with his registration papers, could vote at as many
polls as he could visit in one day.</p>

<p>The purport of the third bulwark of Warmothism, the
constabulary law, was to vest in the governor special
power to keep the peace. With the consent of the Senate
he might appoint one chief constable in each parish, whose
duty it should be to preserve the peace, quell disturbances
and riots, and upon warrant of any competent court,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>summarily arrest all persons charged with murder,
assaults, robberies, arson, and riots, subject to the power
of the governor. The chief constable of the parish was
to assign to each precinct a deputy constable to perform
his duties. Offices of all existing constables were declared
vacant and the governor empowered to bring in a
set of his loyal followers at once.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The militia bill provided the necessary military power
to enforce the execution of the preceding laws. Under
its provisions the governor was constituted Commander-in-Chief
of all the militia and could organize, arm, equip,
and uniform as many of the able-bodied male citizens
between the ages of eighteen and forty-five as he deemed
necessary and call the same into active service. Full
lists were to be submitted from each parish to the governor
from which he might assign a sufficient number of persons
to make up five regiments. He was to appoint officers
for terms of two years to carry out details under his
direction. And the sum of $100,000 was appropriated
to carry out the act.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Several minor bills helped to build up this autocratic
power of the executive. Against stormy debate and
attacks on its constitutionality, a bill was passed which
authorized the governor to issue a warrant for the arrest
of any person committing a crime punishable by death
or penitentiary imprisonment upon failure of the regularly
constituted officials to seize him, to be tried in a parish or
district court. Although the accused was assured of the
service of attorney, the bill violated State feeling by
obliterating parish lines, and by allowing high fees to the
sheriff, levied on the parish where the offense occurred.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
Likewise, the bill which rendered the Metropolitan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>Police Board no longer responsible to the recognized legal
tribunals,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and which did not require a bond in case suit was
brought against it, was only freeing his hands the more.
Nor should the reader fail to notice in this connection, as
the last link in the chain, that the governor could, under the
new city charter, absolutely control the city politics until
after the election, a period of seven months of grace for
manipulating his wires.</p>

<p>Legislation so vital and revolutionary as the measures
just outlined and those appropriating State aid, naturally,
aroused hostility, not only within the legislature, but also
outside, where it raged even more violently, if possible.
The Democratic press was thoroughly alarmed; it attacked
the various bills continually and held the most
dire threats over the heads of the Senators who dared to
support them.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Fiery language was intended to stir the
people to action.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Feeling rose to its greatest intensity
over the four most important bills.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Significant calls for
secret meetings, signed K. W. C. and I. C. U.,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> appeared
in the papers, and mass meetings began to be held both
for and against the bills. The Republican party met in
mass meeting on January 27 in the hall of the Representatives
to urge the Assembly to pass these bills without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>delay. This action was probably to forestall and nullify
the effect of a vast mass meeting of the opponents of the
legislation, which was arranged to take place, January 31
in Lafayette Square. The call was issued to all citizens
“opposed to the financial schemes now pending before
the legislature, calculated to increase the burdens of
the people, depreciate the bonds, and ruin the credit of the
people, and cripple commerce.”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The enthusiasm of the
crowd here almost outstripped that of the leaders. Said
one speaker: “It is designed not to defend, but to plunder
the country, and take away the liberties of the people.
What is to be done?”</p>

<p>“Kill them,” came the prompt response from the crowd.</p>

<p>“Ah, no, not yet. But put your foot down and say
that this thing shall not be. There is power in the fixed
determination of the people, and if the bills are then passed,
do as Boston did to the minions of George III. What is
to be done with a Legislature that does these things?”</p>

<p>“Lynch them,” was the verdict of his hearers.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>A series of resolutions was passed protesting against
the proposed bills as destructive of the freedom of elections
and as creating an absolute despot of the executive,
and denouncing their advocates as public enemies. Men
gave the world notice that they intended to use all the
means in their power to prevent the payment of any bonds
or other obligations of the State which were not indispensably
necessary to the proper administration of the
government, and threatened openly to vote for no man
who would not refuse to vote any appropriations for such
obligations.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Committees in every parish sought to obtain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>the signatures of the citizens of the State to the above
resolutions, and a delegation of one hundred citizens was
chosen to present them to the governor and the Assembly.</p>

<p>The governor’s reception of the committee was cordial,
but his response contained some remarkable charges;
he laid the blame for the excesses on lobbyists who knew
how to manipulate the negroes, and laid the corruption
at the door of individuals and corporations who represented
the very best people; nor did he scruple to withhold
names.</p>

<p>“The bill (the five million bond bill) went to the Senate.
I walked into the Senate chamber and saw nearly every
prominent broker of the city engaged in lobbying that bill
through the Senate, and it was only by exposing the fact
that one of their emissaries had come into this very
chamber and laid upon the desk of my secretary an order
for $50,000 that I was able to defeat it. Mr. Conway,
the mayor of your city, came here and offered me any
consideration to induce me to sign this bill.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The visit of the delegates to the Senate on February 2
degenerated into pure farce. A long and amusing debate
as to whether they should receive them or not took place
before the delegates, as by some misunderstanding they had
crowded into the chamber before the Senators had settled
this momentous question. And Pinchback explained in
great detail that he had been obliged to admit them at
once or they “would go off with an additional excuse
that we would not listen to the representatives of the
people.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> After the reading of the resolutions the delegates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>were virtually asked to leave<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and the indignation
of the Senators found wordy expression.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Though the
suggestion to return the resolutions as “disrespectful and
insulting” was not adopted, the latter were promptly
tabled.</p>

<p>The attempt with the House on the same day met with
no more success, though preliminary arrangement for a
ten-minute recess prevented any such undignified parley
as had occurred in the other body. But the House took
much the same attitude of offense toward the resolutions
and buried them in a special committee.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Nominating conventions for the selection of candidates
for State officers were held in the month of September
by both the Republican and Democratic parties. A feature
of both conventions was the appearance of a large
number of colored delegates. Inquiries were sent to the
Democratic State Central Committee as to the admission
of colored delegates and so the committee in the regular
address to the people took occasion to voice the party
sentiment in the following language:</p>

<p>“The interests of both white and black men are identical
in this struggle. Whatever rights and privileges either
enjoy under the constitution are sacred, and it is the duty
of every citizen to see that they are maintained. The
Democratic party has always upheld and defended the
constitution of the country and will now, as ever in
the past, protect and defend every citizen in the full and
free exercise of all rights guaranteed by that instrument.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>It declared its platform to be retrenchment and reform,
reduction of the debt and taxation, rebuilt levees,
restored confidence, and a desire to develop the agricultural
resources of the State.</p>

<p>The election was remarkable for its peaceful character.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
But later investigation established the fact that there
was much fraud both in connection with the appointment
of registrars and in the count of the election ballots. The
law required the appointment of registrars six months before
election. Yet in August but two had been appointed.
It was charged that the governor purposely delayed
appointment in order to influence the August convention.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
He had appointed in at least sixteen parishes Democratic
supervisors of registration on the score that it was
hard to find competent Republicans willing to undertake
it and that it was good policy.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The same investigation
concluded that “there is no doubt that most scandalous
frauds were committed by and with the connivance of
some of these registrars,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> sometimes in the interest of
Republicans and sometimes in the interest of Democratic
candidates.”<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> An old negro, who had been nominated,
was astonished at the result of the count and cried: “Is it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>possible I have no vote come out of the box? ’Fore God,
I know I vote for myself.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>A considerable number of registrars, clerks, and friends
of registrars were returned elected to the legislature.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
Carr, who was returned from De Soto Parish without a
nomination, was not even a resident of that parish,<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> nor
was his the only case of that kind. It was conspicuous
that fraudulently returned members were friends of the
governor,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and he was charged with direct complicity in
two cases. Some rioting, notably at Donaldsonville
and Baton Rouge, was reported.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> This naturally gave
rise to many contested elections which hung on to furnish
the opponents of the governor their opportunity in 1872.</p>

<p>It was a clear Republican victory. Graham and Dubuclet,
the Republican candidates for auditor and treasurer,
came in with majorities of about twenty-five
thousand each, and that party secured majorities in both
branches of the Assembly. The four constitutional amendments
were submitted to popular vote and adopted.
The amendment to Article 99 was indorsed unanimously.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>An interesting fact is to be noted here. In the spring
of 1868, while the Democracy was wholly unorganized
and the negroes aggressive under the protection of the
military government, the State went Republican, but was
carried by a reinvigorated Democratic party in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>Presidential election of November of the same year; but
in 1870 it swung back to the party in power.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> But there
are two perfectly intelligible explanations which do not
necessarily invalidate the vote for Seymour in 1868: the
new election law and the Enforcement Act of May 31,
1870,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> which imposed heavy penalties for infringement
upon the right to vote.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">The Beginning of Warmoth’s Downfall</p>


<p>The first hints of dissension within what may be
accurately called Warmoth’s party came as early
as January, 1870. The element which was to
become so notorious as the “Custom-House” faction had
already made its appearance in Louisiana politics. A
resolution introduced into the House in the early days
of the session recognized the existence of separate organizations
contending for recognition as the Central Republican
Club, and designated the men of the New Orleans
custom-house as “erring” members.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> A certain tension
seems to have been present in the attitude of the House
toward all questions respecting the custom-house. When
the House sought information concerning its own members
who were in the employ of the custom-house, Collector
Casey refused it, as he was not a State officer.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>The cause of the personal opposition to Warmoth is to
be traced, no doubt, to the movement for the removal of
his ineligibility for a second term, which caused alarm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>to the other Republican aspirants for that honor.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Organizations
were soon covertly started to defeat the
amendment at the polls, according to Warmoth’s statement.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Opposition, however, first became open at the
Republican State Convention which assembled at New
Orleans, August 9, 1870, for the nomination of a ticket and
the appointment of a State Central Committee. It was
felt that the governor was taking extraordinary pains to
control that convention, especially as he had been elected
a delegate by a club which the committee did not recognize.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
Both he and the lieutenant-governor, who was also
present as a delegate, were nominated to preside, but
here the former met his first check: he was defeated by his
negro subordinate. As the civil rights bill of the preceding
session still lay unsigned in the hands of the governor,
a resolution of censure was urged by the custom-house
officials on the score that he had sold out his radical
principles to the Democrats; but after a heated discussion,
in which Warmoth defended his action, the matter was
dropped and his conduct virtually indorsed.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The convention
denounced special legislation and pledged its
best endeavors to check it.</p>

<p>The State Central Committee consisted regularly of
fifteen members, ten appointed by the convention, five by
the chair. As organized, the five appointees of the chair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>were opposed to the re-eligibility amendment and won
over a majority of the whole committee. Hence, the
governor refused to contribute to the regular campaign
funds or to encourage his friends to do so, but levied forced
contributions upon all his appointees on pain of dismissal,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
organized an auxiliary committee, and began a canvass
of his own, in many instances in favor of candidates
not regularly nominated by the party.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> He had tickets
printed in favor of the amendment,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and, as we have seen,
scored a victory at the polls. To Dunn’s complaint that
the Warmoth faction had violated custom in organizing
an auxiliary committee, he retorted that the regular
committee was trying to prevent a fair expression of
opinion on the amendment.</p>

<p>Before the legislature met on January 2, 1871, the friends
of the governor entered, with his knowledge, into a coalition<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
with the Democrats of the Senate, whereby they
robbed the lieutenant-governor of his patronage by taking
the appointment of committees into their own hands,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
and made Democrats chairmen and majority members
of several of the committees,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> thus insuring their seats<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>to certain members who had been fraudulently elected.</p>

<p>By the same coalition Carr was re-elected speaker on
the first day, receiving every Democratic vote.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The
committees of both houses were thus so constituted that
anti-Warmoth men were powerless to rid the legislature
of ineligible members. Dissatisfaction with Carr’s rulings,
however, was so loudly expressed that about the middle
of the session he was compelled by a union of Democrats
with the custom-house faction to resign, and Colonel
Carter of Cameron, old and rather deaf,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> was elected in
his place.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Opportunity was now afforded for a reconstruction
of the Committee on Elections, which, although
unable to complete its investigation before the recess, by
an adverse report on four members at the next session,
ultimately helped to complicate an already intricate
situation.</p>

<p>The choice of a United States Senator on January 10
to succeed J. S. Harris served still further to antagonize
the custom-house faction against Warmoth. James F.
Casey, collector of the port, who had, up to this time, acted
in harmony with the administration party, desired this
honor for himself,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> but the governor threw his influence
in favor of General J. R. West, who, supported by the
Democrats under fear of the election of the negro Pinchback,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
was elected on the first ballot in both houses.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>Casey was soon found among the governor’s most violent
enemies.</p>

<p>In view of the peaceful election of the preceding autumn
and the general quiet of the State, the hopeful words of
the governor’s message do not sound as absurd as events
destined to occur within little more than a year were to
prove them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot pass from this subject to other details, in justice,
without calling your attention to the general and peaceable
acquiescence of our people in the results of the reconstruction
policy of the general government. Their acceptance of it as a
finality has been much more satisfactory in Louisiana than
in any other state in the South.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>
</div>

<p>While urging the encouragement of public improvements,
he warned the Assembly against certain schemes
of plunder “which are already organizing and will continue
to be organized and presented to you for votes,”
and insisted that the commonwealth’s state of bonded
indebtedness must preclude any further appropriations
as subsidy. Adequate penalty for bribery,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> which had, he
acknowledged, become a “crying evil,” amendments to
the public land laws, the police jury system, the restoration
of the old capitol at Baton Rouge, and a larger
measure of home rule for New Orleans are subjects which
appear in his message for the first time.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Although
defending the legislation of the previous session, he
recommended with studied vagueness of expression the
modification of the election and registration laws:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The violent rancor of that period (1868) having now given
place to a more liberal and just acknowledgment of the true
relations of all our citizens, I commend to your consideration
the modification of the registration and election laws to an
extent, that, while securing the inalienable rights of all, will
make the usage under them less irksome and exacting to the
few.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Together with his message he returned without his
approval ten bills to the Senate,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and three to the House.
The veto power was very freely used by Governor Warmoth.
Up to January 1, 1871, he had vetoed thirty-nine
bills<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and suffered others to become law without his
approval by lapse of the constitutional time limit, because
they were passed by such a majority as to have made “his
veto a useless bit of friction.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> His courage in boldly
vetoing some measures very close to the hearts of his
legislators should not pass unnoted, nor the strength of
his influence, for only five, up to this time, were able to
muster the requisite two-thirds majority in the face of
his opposition.</p>

<p>The legislature took to heart the governor’s statement
that the questions most urgent were such measures as
would most speedily “bring railroads, open natural watercourses,
and facilitate ocean commerce,” without heeding
his warning of the need for rigid economy. The orgy
of voting away paper money to aid paper railroads and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>canals went on with even greater frenzy than before. It
was unfortunate that the governor did not carry the
courage of his convictions further and instead of vetoing
but six bills, do his part to quash the thirteen laws<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> which
appropriated over $800,000 in actual subsidies; which
granted away valuable timber along with the right of
way to a new railroad; and which granted exemption
from taxation to another canal company. The loose
extension of $40,000, which had been appropriated the
preceding session for the removal of obstructions in
Bayou Bartholomew, to “what more might be necessary”<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
is indicative of the business care applied to the State
pocket-book. The governor’s signature to the bill for
the purchase of a site and erection of a State capitol<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
may be regarded as raising the State indebtedness by one
and one-half million dollars. He suffered an act guaranteeing
the second mortgage bonds of another railroad to
become law without his signature,<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> but the measure which
guaranteed the principal and interest of a warehouse
company to the amount of over a million dollars was
obliged to pass over his veto.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> The total amount added
to the State debt by this Assembly amounted to about
four million dollars. Nineteen different appropriation
bills were passed, aside from those granting subsidies.</p>

<p>But it was apparent by this time that much of this
effort to stimulate development by State aid was barren
of result. Some roads which had received State aid had
nothing to show for it, and committees of investigation
“to ascertain whether the said company has complied
with the conditions of the act” incorporating it were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>beginning to appear.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> So strong was the feeling that the
governor recommended to the next legislature that unless
work be begun actively within six months, certain railroads
should lose their charters.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>The vexatious levee problem seemed to have found a
solution. When the serious crevasses which threatened
New Orleans with inundation appeared in the spring,
the governor assumed control and closed the breaks with
the aid of State engineers. The Louisiana Levee Company
was then formed and its interests made identical with
those of the State. The company contracted to construct,
maintain, and control levees on both banks of the
Mississippi and its tributaries according to the requirements
of a competent commission of three able engineers;
to construct at least three million cubic yards each year
until the levee was completed to the required standard.
To get the company started the State subscribed a considerable
sum and levied a special tax of two-tenths per
cent for twenty-one years for a repair fund, and, in the
absence of any tax for the current year, issued bonds to
the amount of one million dollars.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Although a number of additional schools had been put
in operation,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> the superimposed Northern school law still
proved unsatisfactory for Louisiana and came up for
further amendment. Forty thousand dollars was fleeced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>from the people annually for salaries of school administrators
and incidental expenses, outside of the teachers’
salaries and other expenses. School directors were often
unable to write their names. A letter from the president
of the school board of Carroll Parish, as printed in the
<i>National Republican</i>, is so ungrammatical and misspelled
that it is almost impossible to read it.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Cain Sartain,
who later figured as a Representative, now a school
teacher, was appallingly ignorant.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Naturally demands
for the abolition of this costly and inefficient establishment
were incessant. The supplement passed this session tended
to simplify the law, but the chief change was provision
for the appointment by a State board of subordinate
boards of school directors for the several parishes, towns,
and cities, who should have charge of all the funds and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>school records, all to be under the direction of the division
superintendent. An additional tax of one to two mills
was to be levied on the taxable property of the parish.
Special individual provision was made for the board in
New Orleans and for the levying of a special tax to the
amount requested by the board. But a section of the
revenue law which prohibited the city from collecting
taxes in excess of two per cent<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> would have closed the
schools, as the limit had already been exceeded, except for
the aid rendered by the State superintendent and the city
government.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Still the system awakened great dissatisfaction,
even the colored people grumbling. The governor,
by the appointment of Conway, a Republican and intimate
friend, to the headship of the school-system, erected it into
a political machine.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Agreeably to the governor’s recommendation, bills to
modify both the election and registration<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> laws were
introduced into the Senate about the middle of the session,
but were not pressed through, largely, it was charged,
because of the governor’s secret opposition. An effort
to tamper still further with the government of New
Orleans,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and a generous appropriation for the militia<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
passed both houses but failed, apparently, to secure the
governor’s signature. Some attention was devoted to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>the labor problem and to the question of creating parishes.
The latter subject, probably for political reasons, had
been something of a mania with the legislature, until at
this session<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> the proposition was urged with much force
“to stop the legislature from creating new parishes unless
authorized by the voters of the parishes to be divided.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>The extravagance and state of utter corruption of the
legislative body in 1871-2 were only the natural result of
the conditions started in 1868-9.</p>

<p>The amount of the State debt was disputed. The
governor held that it was, in round numbers, $22,000,000,
while the auditor claimed it to be $41,000,000, the difference
to be accounted for by a contingent debt of $18,000,000
dependent on the construction of railroads, the
second mortgage bonds of which the State had agreed to
indorse.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The bonded debt was $19,188,300, the annual
interest on which amounted to $1,403,820, besides which
there was a miscellaneous debt of $3,187,490.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> A comparison
of the debt with the period just preceding the Warmoth
administration is suggestive, as it had increased
over $8,000,000 since 1868, taking the conservative
estimate,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> growing by deficiencies at the rate of over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>$1,000,000 a year. The expenditures in 1870 had exceeded
the income by over $1,000,000 although the deficit was
more than covered by the balance in the State treasury
at the beginning of the year. The total amount of bonds
or aid granted by the State to various corporations, prior
to 1871 and for which bonds had not yet been issued, was
over twelve millions. The auditor estimated the probable
expenditures of 1872 at something over three millions,
but as a matter of fact they far exceeded that sum.</p>

<p>The total amount of taxable property in the State at the
close of 1871 was $250,594,417.50 from which $4,605,475.02
in taxes was collected.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> With this should be
compared the valuation and taxes in 1870 to show the
decrease. The valuation was the same—$251,296,017.02,—but
the taxes collected were $6,490,028.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The unpaid
taxes amounted in 1871 to nearly five millions, exclusive
of the taxes due for 1870 and of the taxes in a number
of parishes where no rolls of assessment had been made.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
The aggregate tax in the State was fourteen and one-half
mills on the dollar.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> So great was the burden of this
taxation that in some parishes whole forty-acre tracts
of land, as rich as any in the Nile, were sold that year by
the tax-gatherer for one dollar, and in many instances
estates absolutely found no bidders. Large owners were
willing to give half their acres to immigrant families on
the sole condition that they should settle on and improve
the land given them. A company was being formed
in northern Louisiana to divide 50,000 acres of land in
tracts of fifty acres to a family. Real estate declined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>within the years 1870-1 not less than twenty-five per cent.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
What was formerly considered very good security, mortgage
paper for instance, had become of little value, because
in a few years at that rate of taxation no one could pass the
papers, for in case of foreclosure the property bore with
it the burden of five, six, or seven per cent taxes which
would leave no revenue.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The picture of the financial
state drawn by a distinguished Democrat about this time is
worthy of quotation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If we were threatened with the continuance of the power
which has administered this government, the conflagration
of Chicago would not be more desolating than the effect of the
continuance of this legislation would be upon the city of New
Orleans; and the reason of it is this: when the city of Chicago
was burned to the ground the people had at least the ground
left, and northern and eastern capitalists have come there to
rebuild it, while with us, capital is flying from the state, commerce
is decreasing, and everybody who can is trying to get
away.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The cost of collecting the tax was excessive. Ten per
cent of the amount was allowed for assessment and collection
in all but portions of New Orleans where five per cent
was deducted. The mere cost to the State of gathering in
the taxes in 1871 was close to $500,000 out of a total of
$6,500,000.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> This made the cost of collection over twelve
per cent.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The poll-tax in the second district of New
Orleans for 10,146 persons amounted to but $1911, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>of this sum, after the cost of assessment and collection
was deducted, only $800.85 was left to the treasury.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>The legislative session of 1871 cost $958,956.50, although
the Assembly appropriated only $641,400, the average
cost of each Senator amounting to about $5300, of each
Representative, $7300, making the average cost of a
member $113.50 per day.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> With this statement should
be compared the cost before the war, when the largest
amount ever appropriated for an ordinary session was
$100,000.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The explanation of the enormous difference
is to be found in the governor’s comment<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was squandered in paying extra mileage and per diem of
members for services never rendered<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>; for an enormous corps
of useless clerks and pages,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> for publishing the journals of
each house in fifteen obscure parish newspapers, some of which
never existed, while some never did the work<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>; in paying extra
committees authorized to sit during the vacation and to travel
throughout the State and into Texas<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>; and in an elegant
stationery bill which included ham, champagne, etc.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>The official reporter in the Senate drew the munificent
salary of twenty dollars per day,<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> while each
representative of a newspaper received a generous
gratuity.</p>

<p>The enormous printing bills were, of course, a result of
corruption. The public printing had cost the State in
three years $1,500,000,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> a goodly share of which Warmoth
was accused of obtaining because of his fourth interest in
the State paper.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Under the law the three commissioners
named a State printer for the journals, laws, and debates,
but they were also authorized to have the printing done
by certain country papers. In addition the House and
Senate claimed the right to select other country papers
to publish these documents officially, to be paid from the
contingent funds, so that thirty-five or forty more were so
selected. The sum of $180,000 was paid to papers in New
Orleans in 1871, outside of the official organ.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Many of
the papers were sustained only by these contracts.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> It
was generally believed that men were sent over the
country to edit these papers in order to build up the
interests of the governor, while Carter, on the other hand,
openly admitted that he gave his patronage to papers
which would support the reform movement.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>The entire lack of conscience of the men who were
administering the government came to light during the
close of this year and early in 1872 with appalling vividness,
until one turns away simply sickened by the tale
of corruption.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Neither party nor class lines regulated
integrity,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> for reputable men of both sides were among
the persons who offered bribes. As Carter put it, “There
seems to be something in the climate here that affects
both parties.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Under oath one man declared that it was
generally understood all round that any one who wanted
to get a bill through had to pay for it. He thought there
was a regular office opened down on Royal Street for that
purpose where there was an agent for members. He had
seen money paid right on the floor of the House. After
the passage of the Chattanooga bill he saw a man with his
hands full of money paying it out to members with little
attempt at concealment.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Senators under false names
were incorporators of many of the companies chartered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>and got their shares of stock after the bills were passed.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
So wide-spread was the knowledge of their dishonesty
that the story was current that the members had not
even time to write their promises to vote the passage of
such and such a bill, but had to resort to printed blanks.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>One of the dishonest measures, not mentioned elsewhere,
should not be passed without brief mention, at
least. In 1870<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> the legislature authorized the improvement
of the old city park, a piece of ground which had
been held for the purpose for many years. During the
following year two politicians, Southworth and Bloomer,
got a written agreement from the owners of a large vacant
piece of land—the only large tract near the city—to sell it
to them at a fixed price, six hundred thousand dollars.
The legislature of 1871 amended the park law so as to
allow the commissioners to buy land for the new park
and made an appropriation for it. The governor now
appointed as park commissioners, Pinchback, West, and
Southworth. They next acquired title to the property,
but paid only sixty-five thousand dollars, the remainder
being left on mortgage. August 15 they sold one-half
their purchase to the city for eighty thousand dollars,
receiving sixty-five thousand dollars in cash, and one
hundred ninety-five thousand in bonds. It was common
street talk that Antoine complained that Pinchback had
cheated him out of forty thousand dollars, which he in
some way expected out of the deal.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>The evidence fails of proof that the governor ever received
a bribe for his action on any bill,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> but it is difficult
to escape the suspicion of his complicity in corrupt transactions,
if it be true, as was alleged, that no bill which the
governor favored could fail and none that he opposed could
pass. He admitted his use of his patronage to remove
personal enemies and appoint friends “as a custom of
governors”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> and that the government had been guilty
of some abuses created by his connivance, but emphatically
denied the perpetration of any frauds,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> declaring on oath
that he stood before the Congressional committee with
“clean hands.”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> But his duplicity in other ways seems
clear, while the fact stands out that with a salary of eight
thousand dollars a year he testified that he had made
far more than one hundred thousand dollars the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>year of his administration<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and by 1872 was reported
worth a million dollars. He was surely willfully deluding
himself when he uttered this boast:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe I have since I have been governor of the State, under
circumstances and embarrassments of the gravest character,
and under difficulties that I am surprised myself that I have
been able to overcome, administered the State government
in the best interests of the people of the State, and have
produced as much harmony, good feeling, and prosperity
as it was possible for me or any one else to produce under
the circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In a series of remarkable pen pictures the governor
brought charges of dishonesty against most of the custom-house
reformers—against Senators Ray, Casey, Packard,
Lowell,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Carter.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> His attack on Carter may be considered
typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Carter was also, and is now, the paid attorney of the
New Orleans, Mobile, and Texas Railroad Company, from
which he receives $833.33 per month, or $10,000 per annum,
and for which he has never done one hour’s service. The
contract for his employment was made with him by the
company after he had kept in his pocket for thirty or sixty
days a bill which had passed the legislature almost unanimously,
and immediately after this contract was made, by
which he became the attorney of the company, the bill was
signed by him.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Several of the men attempted no reply to these charges,
and Carter’s explanation served only to convince the
Congressional committee that the charge was substantially
true.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Casey was clearly proved to have been the
holder of a corruption fund of $18,000, part of a $50,000
fund raised by himself and others to bribe the legislature
to pass a bill for a company in which he was an interested
incorporator. When the governor vetoed the bill, Casey
unlocked the safe and Herring returned $18,000. It
required just eighteen senators to pass the bill.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The
president of the Louisiana Lottery Company had a list of
about fifty members of the House with whom he had
made arrangements for the passage of the Jackson Railroad
bill with the amount that had been paid and the sum
still due. The amount with a few exceptions was $600,
but Campbell and Pinchback were rated worth $2000.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
Many members held two offices, quite content to interpret
the constitution in the Louisiana way that a member
of the Assembly was not a State officer.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The governor made a genuine effort to combat the
extravagance of the legislature. In April, 1871, soon
after the adjournment of the Assembly, he applied to the
courts for an injunction to restrain the auditor from
paying warrants for the mileage, per diem, and contingent
expenses of members of the lower house, because fraudulent
vouchers had been issued whereby the amounts
had been increased. The injunction was granted and the
auditor, together with several experts, appointed to
investigate the matter. The governor’s real object was
to assail Speaker Carter by the allegation that he had
coerced the chief clerk to sign a fraudulent journal of the
House, which authorized five committees to sit during
the recess, thus defrauding the State of $200,000. Warmoth
declared that a number of resolutions, which the
speaker stated as introduced and passed the last night,
had been interpolated into the journal, for it was notorious
that they had not been introduced up to half-past eight
o’clock that evening, and that from that moment until the
adjournment the House had been in a constant state of
uproar, during which time it was impossible for the House
to take any action. He advanced what seems considerable
evidence of his charge, while the delay of the publication
of this day’s journal for sixteen days after the adjournment,<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
looks, it will be confessed, suspicious.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The report of the commission sustained the charges of
the governor but in part. It was shown that the amount
of the warrants had in some instances been fraudulently
increased; that warrants to the amount of $240,000 had
been issued in excess of the appropriation of 1871<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>; that
many warrants for extra pay to officers and clerks had
been issued on the resolution of but one house, contrary
to law; that $40,000 had been fraudulently issued to committees
for mileage on official duty, when, according to the
journals, they had not left the city; and that the signatures
of the State officers had been forged in various instances.
The commission condemned the loose manner of conducting
business in the warrant office, but brought no specific
charges. The opposition press charged the governor
with holding up this report for months and publishing it
at the opportune moment for him—just before the assembling
of the legislature in 1872.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>An important decision in regard to the limitation of the
State debt was rendered in May by the State Supreme
Court. The matter came up on appeal from the Eighth
District Court of New Orleans, where a suit had been
instituted to compel the auditor to issue a warrant on
an appropriation of $50,000 made in favor of a Mr. Nixon.
The auditor had refused because the law authorizing it
violated the recent amendment, as it increased the debt
above the constitutional limit. The Supreme Court
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>affirmed the decision of the lower court in favor of the
auditor, contending that “the evidence in the record leaves
no doubt that the debt of the State exceeded twenty-five
million dollars on or before the first of March, 1871.”<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

Nordhoff had the original of the following interesting document: “Gentlemen
of the Finance Committee of La. Levee Co.: Please pay to Hon. A. W.
Faulkner the amount you may deem proper to pay on account of Levee Bill,
I being absent at the time under orders of the House. But I would have voted
for the bill had I been there. Mr. Faulkner is authorized to sign a receipt
for me—Stamps.” Nordhoff, 59. The value of quotations from Nordhoff
may be proved by stating that he declared himself a Republican, never
having “voted any other Federal ticket than the Republican; I have been
opposed to slavery as long as I have had an opinion on any subject except
sugar, candy and tops; and I am a thorough believer in the capacity of the
people to rule themselves, even if they are very ignorant, better than anybody
else can rule them.” 10.</p>

offered him to sign the Nicholson paving bill. Walsh published a card,
saying that the governor had refused it because it was too little. The
latter, naturally, denied this and tried to disprove it by the unsupported
statement of another man, whereupon Walsh sent the governor a challenge.
And so the matter stood—the unproved assertion of one man against the
other. House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 376.</p>

<p>But Scott on the other hand swore that it cost more to get the governor’s
signature than to get it through the legislature. It is to be regretted that
the defense which Mr. Warmoth still expects to write, based, the writer
understands, upon the fact that he prevented still more outrageous wrongs
from being perpetrated, has not yet appeared, as it may throw additional
light upon this question. The writer has applied to him repeatedly in vain
for a statement of his position now after the lapse of forty years.</p>

of Warmoth as voiced in a speech in February, 1872: “Louisiana is afflicted
with worse laws and worse administrators thereof than can be found in
ten states of the Union. Henry Clay Warmoth is the Boss Tweed in Louisiana,
except that that amiable villain, with all his infamies, is a gentlemen and
a saint compared with the unscrupulous despot who fills the executive chair

Carter for eminence. The investigating committee of Congress reported
that he had been under arrest with seven sworn charges of burglary against
him, and had then obtained of the chief of police a certificate that his picture
was not in the rogues’ gallery.—<i>Ibid.</i>, 27.</p>

<p>The conclusion to which the Congressional committee came is worth
noting when we recall that they were Republicans: “The world has rarely
known a legislative body so rank with ignorance and corruption.”—<i>Ibid.</i>, 24.
In May, 1875, five members of this legislature were indicted for bribery.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>In this revolting catalog it is refreshing to find one person free from the
taint of dishonesty. The lieutenant-governor was regarded by the Democrats
as incorruptible. “In the view of the Caucasian chiefs, the taint of
honesty and of a scrupulous regard for the official proprieties, is a serious
drawback and enervating reproach upon the Lieutenant Governor.”—<i>Times</i>,
August 4, 1871.</p>
